# Localization Guide
Althought the Cairn rules exist in many forms (PDF, Google Docs, Word, etc), the [SRD](https://cairnrpg.comcairn-srd.html) is probably the best choice.

## Translating the SRD
1. Copy the [SRD Markdown](https://github.com/yourusername/cairn-lang/cairn-srd.md) to a markdown editor such as [Typora](https://typora.com) or a web-based renderer like [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io). If you know how to use Git, you can use [Atom](atom.io). If you don't know markdown, don't worry! It's easy. Read more [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

2. Do the hard work of translating the core document. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) and [deepl.com](https://deepl.com) are good resources; you can even simply translate the entire document once, then look through it for corrections.

## Forking the Github Repo
1. Create a [Github](https://github.com) account.

2. Go to [the repo](https://github.com/yochaigal/cairn) and click "Fork" in the upper right corner.

3. Name the repo cairn-**lang**, e.g. cairn-fr for French, etc. Your repo should be called something like https://github.com/yourusername/cairn-lang.

4. Copy the translated markdown into the cairn-srd.md file.

5. Translate the other pages in the repo (readme, resources, etc).

6.  Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) to enable github pages on the new repo.

7. If you'd like to make changes to a local version of the website, follow this excellent guide by [David Schirduan](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2018/10/howto-markdown-blog).

## Building the PDF in Affinity Publisher
1. Download the trial of Affinity Publisher, and substitute the translation per word block. I also recreated a couple of tables to make it easier to input. You will need to also sort spells and inventory items by name.

2. Credit yourself and anyone who helped you!

3. Add "**Lang** Version" to the cover.

## Character Sheet
1. Contact [Licopeo](https://twitter.com/LicopeoArt) and ask nicely. Maybe throw him some cash.
