CAIRN
=========================

Based on Knave by Ben Milton and Into The Odd by Chris McDowall, [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) is an attempt at making Into The Odd semi-compatible with popular OSR settings like Dolmenwood. Character generation is quick and random, classless, and relies on fictional advancement rather than through XP or level mechanics.

A print version of Cairn is now available. Pick it up at [Floating Chair](https://floatingchair.club/collections/zines/products/cairn) and [Spear Witch](https://spearwitch.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/cairn) (in the US),  [Monkey's Paw Games](https://monkeyspawgames.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/cairn) (in CA), and [Glaucus](https://gumroad.com/glaucus#ojuPK)â€‹ (in AUS).
More storefronts to come soon (Exalted Funeral, Rook's Press, Soul Muppet).

The PDF version is available for free on [Itch](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn).  
[Here](cairn-srd.md) is the markdown version.
