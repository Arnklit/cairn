Cairn is an [adventure game](http://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr) about a hardened adventurers exploring a dark & mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, classless, and relies on fictional advancement rather than through XP or level mechanics.  
It is based on [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) by Ben Milton and [Into The Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland) by Chris McDowall.

The PDF version is available for free on [Itch.io](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) & [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/330809/Cairn).
