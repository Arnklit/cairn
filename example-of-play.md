# Example of Play

#### Saves
**Esme** & **Borrid** have spent the better part of the day cutting their way into the _Geunant Forest_, chopping through hanging vines and waist-high bramble bushes. **Borrid** stops every few minutes to check the map, relying on his background as a *Hunter* to ensure the party does not get lost. In the late afternoon they finally break through and arrive at the _God-Slip_, a long ravine splitting the forest in two. No bridge spans this part of the ravine, and judging by the sheer rock walls on either side, climbing down would be extremely dangerous. Unfortunately their quarry is most likely located just across, where the cliffs meet the edge of the world. They decide to make camp before moving out.
