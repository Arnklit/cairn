# Where The Wheat Grows Tall

- Converted from the [original work](https://www.exaltedfuneral.com/products/where-the-wheat-grows-tall-pdf) by [Evlyn Moreau](http://chaudronchromatique.blogspot.com/) and [Camilla Greer](https://greerrrr.itch.io/)].
- Buy it in print, if you can. It's fantastic.
- Only what needs to be converted or changed will appear here. If an important detail is missing, refer to the adventure!
- This is a WIP so if you see something amiss, be patient!
