# Hel's Crow's Final Rest

- Based on the [original work](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/377007/Hels-Crows-Final-Rest) by [Gus L.](https://alldeadgenerations.blogspot.com/).
- Conversion by [Sam Wallace](https://rpgs.quajzen.page)

## General Notes
  - The original is free, so grab a copy!
  - The Sea Shrine's dedication as a place of divine power gives enhanced and/or boosted abilities to divine powers players may wield. Turgies' and his minions' attacks are impaired here.

- Can summon 2d6 Giant Crabs outdoors

### Giant Crab
6 HP, 2 Armor, 16 STR, 8 DEX, 4 WIL, claw (d10+d10)
 - These are holy beasts (and thus can damage undead), but could be influenced by diabolic powers.
 - Critical Damage: crab-like carapace begins to form on a limb

### Draugur Reavers
