# Lair of the Lamb
- [Lair of the Lamb](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/lair-of-lamb-final.html) by Arnold K.
- Conversion by [Pelle](https://pellep.itch.io).
- This is a WIP

## Suggestion for character generation


### Ability scores
All 12 peasants start play very dehydrated. For each of STR, DEX and WIL, in order roll 2d6 for a total of 2-12. If a peasant can get hydrated, for each Ability Score roll 1d6 and add to its score for a total of 3-18.


### Profession
Use the Cairn table with Highest Ability Score versus Lowest Ability Score to get a Failed Career number. Use this number to get your Profession from the d100 Profession table in Lair of the Lamb.


### Hit Protection
Roll d4 for Hit Protection.


### Equipment
One lucky peasant starts with a knife (d6).


### Debt
The 12 peasants starting in the dungeon share a debt of 10000s. They were convicted for the crime of breaking a taboo they were not aware of, and were unable to pay their fine. Escaping alive is probably the top priority now though.
