# Winter's Daughter

Converted from the [original work by Gavin Norman](https://necroticgnome.com/products/dolmenwood-winters-daughter). Note that there are [two versions](https://necroticgnome.com/blogs/news/winters-daughter) of this adventure (not including the various 5e/OSE versions). This conversion was written for the original edition.


## Monsters
### Hooded Men (aka Drunes)
12 HP, 9 STR, 12 DEX, 14 WIL, staff wreathed in green flame (d8), Spellbooks (_Charm Person, Magic Missile, Hold Person, Topple Dolmen_)  
- _Charm Person_: Target sees caster as a friend until they succeed a WIL save.
- _Hold Person_: Target is paralyzed until they succeed a WIL save. Undead are _not_ affected.
- _Magic Missile_: A bolt of arcane green energy that causes d6 damage, ignoring mundane armor.
- _Topple Dolmen_: A standing stone levitates from the stone circle and topples onto a spot within 30', doing 4d6 _Blast_ damage on a failed DEX save (the stones move quite slowly).
- On death their bodies turn to ash, leaving only a cloak and staff which reek of arcane energies.
- 1d4 Spellbooks can be recovered from the ashes of _one_ of their corpses.
- Touching the staff for the first time causes 1d4 WIL damage. Survivors have power over the staff, which allows the bearer to hear the thoughts of others.
