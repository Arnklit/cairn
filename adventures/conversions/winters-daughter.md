# Winter's Daughter

Converted from the [original work by Gavin Norman](https://necroticgnome.com/products/dolmenwood-winters-daughter). Note that there are [two versions](https://necroticgnome.com/blogs/news/winters-daughter) of this adventure (not including the various 5e/OSE versions). This conversion was written for the original edition. In general, very little changes are necessary to run the adventure as written.

## Magic Items
### Ring of Soul Binding
- Unwilling should make a WIL save.

## Encounters

## Outside The Mound
### Random Events
- Gazing at the violet-eyed owl: save WIL to avoid fainting.
- Gust of wind: DEX save to avoid taking 1 STR damage.

## 1. Approaching the Burial Mound
- Run as written.

## 2. Sacrifice at the Whything Stones
- Run as written except for the Drunes here. Their possessions are the same, but see notes below on staves and Spellbooks.
- "Young woman" (Briar-Anne) is standard NPC (4HP, 10/10/10).

### Hooded Men (aka Drunes)
12 HP, 9 STR, 12 DEX, 14 WIL, staff wreathed in green flame (d8), Spellbooks (_Charm Person, Magic Missile, Hold Person, Topple Dolmen_)  
- _Charm Person_: Target sees caster as a friend until they succeed a WIL save.
- _Hold Person_: Target is paralyzed until they succeed a WIL save. Undead are _not_ affected.
- _Magic Missile_: A bolt of arcane green energy that causes d6 damage, ignoring mundane armor.
- _Topple Dolmen_: A standing stone levitates from the stone circle and topples onto a spot within 30', doing 4d6 _Blast_ damage on a failed DEX save (the stones move quite slowly).
- On death their bodies turn to ash, leaving only a cloak and staff which reek of arcane energies.
- 1d4 Spellbooks can be recovered from the ashes of _one_ of their corpses.
- Touching the staff for the first time causes 1d4 WIL damage. Survivors have power over the staff, which allows the bearer to hear the thoughts of others.

## 3. Tomb Entrance
### Door
- Two _normal_ PCs must make a successful STR save per attempt to move the slab.
- Breaking the slab is easier provided the PCs have the equipment and time (see notes about the noise).

- DEX save to avoid being heard by the worms.

## 5.
### Religious Objects
4 HP, 1 Armor, bash (1d4)

- Run as written.

## 7. Freezing Mirror
### Full-Length Mirror
- WIL save to pass in front without becoming paralyzed.

## 8. Family Crypt
### Floating Skeletons
10 HP, 5 WIL, 8 STR, 13 DEX, claws (1d4)

- Any melee weapon that makes contact with the Skelton becomes momentarily weightless (next attack is _impaired_).

## 9. Chapel of St. Sedge
- Run as written.

## 10. Abandoned Priest's Quarters
### 3 Wormtongues
4 HP, 1 Armor, acid bite (1d4)
- Critical damage: acid eats at flesh and clothing. Lose 1 STR per round until washed off.

### A Loose Flagstone
- Any thorough search will discover the loose flagstone.
- Poison needle trap: suffer 1d4 STR damage and fall unconscious for 1d12 minutes.
- See rules for [Scrolls](/cairn-srd/#magic) and [_Hold Person_](/adventures/conversions/winters-daughter/#hooded-men-aka-drunes) note above.
- Holy wafers: Anyone eating a single wafer provides an immense sense of well-being and peace. Eating three or more causes the person to fall into a deep sleep for 1d4 hours.
