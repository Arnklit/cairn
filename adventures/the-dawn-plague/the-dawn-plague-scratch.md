# The Dawn Plague Scratch

## 7. Froyim’s Home
* **Froyim Greydinger** makes his home here. He is a well-respected merchant in these parts.
* Behind the unusually  modern cottage  is a small garden. A large tree sits in the Northwest corner.
* The **Ghoul’s** first victim, as he travels frequently between his home and the coast.
* Upon arrival, the PCs will find the door smashed open and blood splattered everywhere.
* **Froyim’s** body is in the back garden, torn to shreds. If not burnt, it will rise as a **Ghoul** at dawn.
* Poking the tree’s moss will reveal a **Will O’ Wisp**. It quickly floats away, towards **Blue Forest**.
