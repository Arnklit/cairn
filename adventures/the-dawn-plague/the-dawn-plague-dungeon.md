# The Dawn Plague Dungeon

## Throughout:
- Letters carved above each doorway, indicating the room's function and spiritual value.
- The smell of dried mud, decay and burnt-out candles.
- The walls of most rooms are made of earthen clay.

## Upper Level
### Pedestal (**The Crown**)
- The stairs from the **Schul** descend into a central hub.
- **South**: Mostly blocked up by brackish mud. No light pours through the cracks on top.  
- **West**: To **Inner Chamber**, walls lined with words; a swirling maelstrom of letters.
- **East**: To **Courtyard**, the smell of dead flowers; the sounds of rushing water.

### Inner chamber (**Understanding**)
- Workshop
- Half-built golems

### Courtyard (**Wisdom**)
- A fountain, dead & filled with refuse
- Tunnels/water

## Lower Level
### Outer Chamber (**Disipline**)
- Refuse pit to courtyard

### Water Veins (**Kindness**)
- Whirlpool (rushing waters)
- Aquae Vitae (trap/puzzle)
- Wooden poles & parchment

### Burial Chamber (**The Crown**)
-

## Bottom Level
### Treasury (**Beauty**)
- A chamber of souls
- Dybbuks

### The Shrine **Splendor**
-

### (**Victory**)
-

### The Engine Room (**Foundation**)
- **Alukah**???

### Throne Room (**Kingship**)

## Multiple Entrances/Exits
- One entrance is beneath a rotating platform in the **Schul** (the pedestal)
- Another entrance via the **Orphan's Mound**

## Consider why it was built in the first place
- At the founding of the town, nearly 100 years before.
- Originally used as an underground tomb for the town's deceased; additionally a vault was built to house the town's wealth later expanded to deal with the great numbers of corpses resulting from the Dawn Plague thirty years before.
- Originally designed to keep townsfolk away from the hidden wealth; later to prevent Ghouls from raising the dead.

## Levels
- the **The Crown** (upper level), entrance from the **Schul**. Gradual descent from two different staircases
- Western staircase: the inner chamber (second level)
- Eastern Staircase: burial chamber (second level); has a vertical shaft leading from it and down into the outer chamber
- the outer chamber + tombs

## Have loops

## Have a lot of verticality

## Create secret areas/zones

## Variety in Room types

## Tactically useful areas

## Spying opportunities

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

## ideas:
- Trap: an obvious painting on the ground/wall of whatever trap is behind it. Pressure tears the canvas, triggering the trap.
- Rooms: Sepirot stuff?
- False wells
- Head wires above tombs
- Powders that are inhaled
- Failed golems
- mercury addiction
