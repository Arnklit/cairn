# The Dawn Plague Dungeon

### Multiple Entrances/Exits

### Consider why it was built in the first place
- How long ago?
- What was it used for? Is it different now?
- What was it designed to keep out?

### Levels

### Have loops

### Have a lot of verticality

### Create secret areas/zones

### Variety in Room types

### Tactically useful areas

### Spying opportunities

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

### ideas:
- Trap: Trompe-l'oiel painting of a spike pit. If you walk over you fall through canvas onto a spike pit.
- Rooms: Sepirot stuff?
