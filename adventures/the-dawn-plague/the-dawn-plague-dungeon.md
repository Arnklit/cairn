# The Dawn Plague Dungeon

### Multiple Entrances/Exits

### Consider why it was built in the first place
- At the founding of the town, nearly 100 years before.
- Originally used as an underground tomb for the town's deceased; additionally a vault was built to house the town's wealth later expanded to deal with the great numbers of corpses resulting from the Dawn Plague thirty years before.
- Originally designed to keep townsfolk away from the hidden wealth; later to prevent Ghouls from raising the dead.

### Levels

### Have loops

### Have a lot of verticality

### Create secret areas/zones

### Variety in Room types

### Tactically useful areas

### Spying opportunities

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

### ideas:
- Trap: Trompe-l'oiel painting of a spike pit. If you walk over you fall through canvas onto a spike pit.
- Rooms: Sepirot stuff?
