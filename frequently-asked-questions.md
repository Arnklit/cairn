### Game Setup
Two Player Characters, **Esme** (a dual-wielder with the _Herbalist_ background) & **Borrid**, a former _Hunter_. They are in search of an ancient [**Relic**](/cairn-srd.html#magic), rumored to have restorative powers.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How much do PCs "know" and how does that knowledge effect things, mechanically?
**Esme** & **Borrid** have spent the better part of the day cutting their way into the _Geunant Forest_, chopping through hanging vines and waist-high bramble bushes. **Borrid** stops every few minutes to check the map, relying on his background as a *Hunter* to ensure the party does not get lost.

### How does "Initiative" work?
In the late afternoon they finally break through and arrive at the _God-Slip_, a long ravine splitting the forest in two. No bridge spans this part of the ravine, and judging by the sheer rock walls on either side, climbing down would be extremely dangerous. Unfortunately their quarry is most likely located just across, where the cliffs meet the edge of the world. They decide to make camp before moving out.

They set up camp with their backs to the ravine, judging it to be one fewer thing they'd have to worry about at night. Later that evening, the adventurers decide to take turns at keeping watch. **Esme** takes the first shift. Halfway through, she hears a snapping of twigs coming from just to the West of their camp, back towards the _Geunant Forest_.

She slowly leans over towards **Borrid** and kicks him awake. Nodding her head towards the direction of the noise, she makes the symbol for _be quiet_.

_Designer's Notes: This situation is meant to underscore two uncommon aspects of playing Cairn compared to many other RPGs. The first is that the Warden did not have **Esme** make a perception check or Wisdom save to notice the incoming encounter. She just noticed, because the players had agreed to have their PCs take watch and thus are alert to whatever might be out there._

_The second is that provided the creature coming out of the forest is dangerous, the PCs may soon enter combat. In this circumstance, **Esme** does not need to make a DEX save, as she is reasonably ready to combat whatever it is. **Borrid** however is still prone, he will need to make a DEX save to see if he can be readied before whatever comes out of there._
