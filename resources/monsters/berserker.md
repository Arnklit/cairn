# Berserker

10 HP, 1 Armor, 14 STR, 13 DEX, 15 WIL, twin axes (d8+d8)

- Ruthless warriors that back down from a fight, and never taking prisoners.
- Berserkers ignore the **Morale** rule, but also can never be treated as part of a _detachment_.
- **Berserk**: Their first attack has the _enhanced_ and _blast_ quality.
