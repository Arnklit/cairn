# Frequently Asked Questions

#### The Setup
**Ursula** controls **Esme** (a dual-wielder with the _Herbalist_ background) and **Poul** is playing **Borrid**, a former _Hunter_.

The PCs are in search of an ancient [**Relic**](/cairn-srd.html#magic), rumored to have restorative powers. It is rumored to be located deep in the **Geunant Forest**, a wood known for having massive, ancient trees that allow little light through their humongous leaves.

During character generation it was decided that the PCs were both previously employed by the same wealthy benefactor, who owned lands adjacent to their destination.

### How does a PC's knowledge and experience effect the game?
A character's relevant background, history, and experiences may provide a potential benefit (or disadvantage) to certain situations. Similarly, previous events in the game may influence the impact of their actions, including negating the need for a **save** in some circumstances!

_**Esme** & **Borrid** have spent the better part of the day cutting their way into the **Geunant Forest**, chopping through hanging vines and waist-high brambles. **Borrid** stops every few minutes to check the map, relying on his background as a *Hunter* to ensure the party does not get lost._

_Eventually, the party comes across an unusual flowering plant blocking their way. It sits in a solitary sunbeam, dripping a vile green ichor from open, violet pods. **Ursula** asks the Warden if his PC knows the plant. The Warden says yes, **Esme** knows the plant, and that it probably is overgrown on account of the sunbeam drenching it in natural light._

_**Poul** and **Ursula** think on this, and then come up with a way to block the light coming from overhead. They carefully execute this plan (avoiding the thorns, of course) and the pods close up. They move on in safety._

#### How did the Warden decide what the PC should be allowed to know?  
- First, they reasoned that **Esme's** background (_Herbalist) would give her _some_ information about the plant (e.g. that it was poisonous, and how much the light would impact it).  
- Then, they took into account the fact that this forest was known for rarely allowing light to penetrate the large leaves hanging overhead. **Esme** would definitely know this was a major factor.
- Had there been no PC with the _Herbalist_ background, the Warden would likely declare the PCs ignorant of the plant's properties, and (hopefully) the players would follow this by asking questions and experimentation.
- If a PC had a _tangential_ background (like **Borrid's** _Hunter_, for example) the Warden could decide to let the Fates decide and roll 1d6. The higher the roll, the more likely the PC would know something relevant or useful.

### How does "Initiative" work?
_In the late afternoon they finally break through and arrive at the **God-Slip**, a long ravine splitting the forest in two. No bridge spans this part of the ravine, and judging by the sheer rock walls on either side, climbing down would be extremely dangerous. Unfortunately their quarry is most likely located just across, where the cliffs meet the edge of the world. They decide to make camp before moving out._

_They set up camp with their backs to the ravine, judging it to be one fewer thing they'd have to worry about at night. Later that evening, the adventurers decide to take turns at keeping watch. **Esme** takes the first shift. Halfway through, she hears a snapping of twigs coming from just to the West of their camp, back towards the **Geunant Forest**_.

_She slowly leans over towards **Borrid** and kicks him awake. Nodding her head towards the direction of the noise, she makes the symbol for *be quiet*._

#### What
This situation is meant to underscore two uncommon aspects of playing Cairn compared to many other RPGs. The first is that the Warden did not have **Esme** make a perception check or Wisdom save to notice the incoming encounter. She just noticed, because the players had agreed to have their PCs take watch and thus are alert to whatever might be out there.

The second is that provided the creature coming out of the forest is dangerous, the PCs may soon enter combat. In this circumstance, **Esme** does not need to make a DEX save, as she is reasonably ready to combat whatever it is. **Borrid** however is still prone, he will need to make a DEX save to see if he can be readied before whatever comes out of there.
