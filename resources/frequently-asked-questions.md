# Frequently Asked Questions

### Introduction
Below are a few answers to some of the most commonly asked questions from folks new to Cairn.  
For the following examples, consider the following setup in play:

- **Ursula** controls **Esme** (an ex-**Herbalist**), and **Poul** is playing **Borrid**, a former **Hunter**.
- The PCs are in search of a powerful [**Relic**](/cairn-srd.html#magic), rumored to have restorative powers.
- It is rumored to be located deep in the **Geunant Forest**, a wood known for having massive, ancient trees that allow little light through their humongous leaves.
- During character generation it was decided that the PCs were both previously employed by the same wealthy benefactor, who owned lands adjacent to their destination. They recently discovered a hidden parchment detailing their treasure's true location.

### How does a PC's knowledge and experience effect the game?
A character's relevant background, history, and experiences may provide a potential benefit (or disadvantage) to certain situations. Similarly, previous events in the game may influence the impact of their actions, including negating the need for a [**save**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd.html#combat) in some circumstances!

_**Esme** & **Borrid** have spent the better part of the day cutting their way into the **Geunant Forest**, chopping through hanging vines and waist-high brambles. **Borrid** stops every few minutes to check the map, relying on his background as a **Hunter** to ensure the party does not get lost._

_Eventually, the party comes across an unusual flowering plant blocking their way. It sits in a solitary sunbeam, dripping a vile green ichor from open, violet pods. **Ursula** asks the Warden if his PC knows the plant. The Warden says yes, **Esme** knows the plant, and that it probably is overgrown on account of the sunbeam drenching it in natural light._

_**Poul** and **Ursula** think on this, and then come up with a way to block the light coming from overhead. They carefully execute this plan (avoiding the thorns, of course) and the pods close up. They move on in safety._

##### How did the Warden decide what the PC should be allowed to know?  
- First, they reasoned that **Esme's** background (**Herbalist**) would give her _some_ information about the plant (e.g. that it was poisonous, and how much the light would impact it).  
- Then, they took into account the fact that this forest was known for rarely allowing light to penetrate the large leaves hanging overhead. **Esme** would definitely know this was a major factor.

##### What if no one had any relevant experience or expertise?
- Had there been no PC with the **Herbalist** background, the Warden would likely have declared the PCs ignorant of the plant's properties, and (hopefully) the players would try to learn more by asking questions and experimentation.
- If a PC had a _tangential_ background (like the **Hunter**) the Warden could let the [Fates decide](/cairn-srd.html#die-of-fate) and roll 1d6. The higher the roll, the more likely the PC would know something relevant or useful.

### How does the Warden decide turn order?
Some games rely on "Initiative" to determine who goes first when combat begins. In **Cairn**, the PCs must each make a **DEX** save in order to [act before their opponents](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd.html#combat). After that round has been concluded, the two "sides" each take turns attacking, their individual members acting in whatever order they wish. In some cases a **DEX** **save** may _not_ be necessary, especially when the PC or NPC was on guard or ready for an attack.

_In the late afternoon they finally break through and arrive at the **God-Slip**, a long ravine splitting the forest in two. No bridge spans this part of the ravine, and judging by the sheer rock walls on either side, climbing down would be extremely dangerous. Unfortunately their quarry is most likely located just across, where the cliffs meet the edge of the world. They decide to make camp before moving out._

_They set up camp with their backs to the ravine, judging it to be one fewer thing they'd have to worry about at night. Later that evening, the adventurers decide to take turns at keeping watch. **Esme** takes the first shift. Halfway through, she hears a snapping of twigs coming from just to the West of their camp, back towards the **Geunant Forest**. Slowly, she leans over towards **Borrid** and kicks him awake. Nodding her head towards the direction of the noise, she makes the symbol for be quiet. Her companion sits up, just as a pair of horrid red eyes become visible behind the underbrush._

_The Warden asks the players, "What do you do?" Both players agree that combat is likely their only option, agreeing that they would attack at the first sight of danger.  The Warden decrees that **Esme** should not have to make a **DEX** save, as she was at the ready when their opponent first appeared. **Poul** however must make a **DEX** [**save**](cairn-srd.html#rules) to see if his character is able to ready himself for combat in time. He rolls 1d20, and the result is a 17, a fail. The Warden decrees that **Esme** will go first, then their opponent, and finally **Borrid**._

### When Should a PC, NPC or monster **save**?
There are generally to two conditions that _must be met_ under which a PC, NPC or monster should [**save**](cairn-srd.html#rules):
- The outcome of an action is uncertain.
- Something is at risk (a life, a threatening danger, etc.).

Additionally, there are some circumstances (such as making a [**critical damage save**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd.html#combat) during combat) that always call for a **save**.

#### In a contested action, who should save?
If two opponents are both attempting to overcome the other, whomever is most at risk should **save**.

### Without levels or XP, how can PCs advance?
