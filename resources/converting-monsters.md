# Converting Monsters

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems. Here are some tips and guides that might help with the process.

## General tips

### The Basics
Review the instructions in the [SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#creating-monsters). A couple of things to keep in mind:
- STR is both health and physical power. Sometimes HP/HD from other systems is better represented _here_.
- HP is _not_ health. It's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill.
- HD = HP is a good guide, assuming that HD = d6 (averaged) and the minimum is 4 HP (Cairn).
- Sometimes a direct stat to stat translation isn't an option. That's OK! There is a way.

### Use The Fiction
Read the original stat block and surrounding commentary, then write a few sentences about the creature. Then convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.
