# Converting Monsters

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems.  
Here are some tips that might help with the process.  

## The Basics
Review the instructions in the [SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#creating-monsters). A couple of things to keep in mind:
- OSE (or B / X) has really great stat blocks to start with. Just ignore THAC0.
- STR is both health and physical power. Sometimes HP/HD from other systems is better represented _here_.
- Hit Protection is _not_ health. It's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill.
- OSR style HD = HP is a good guide, assuming that HD = d6 (averaged) and the minimum is 4 HP (Cairn).
- Sometimes a direct stat to stat translation isn't an option. That's OK! There is a way.
- WIL is tricky. It's 10 if not noted otherwise; it rarely comes up but when it does, it's nice to have.
- Attacks are usually the easiest coming from B / X (you can usually copy them as-is).Try looking at how much serious damage the creature can do!
- Remember that instead of raising attack damage a step, think about making it _enhanced_ in certain situations or use the "dual-wielding" rule (e.g. d6+d6 is roll 2d6, keep highest).
- Spells are tricky; you can give wizardy-types Spellbooks but remember, the creature might _drop_ them when they are defeated. I like to make 1d4 dropped Spellbooks implode (Luck roll).
- Magical creatures can just "know" a bunch of spells. In this case, make their loot (or body) magically valuable (and dangerous).

## Use The Fiction
Read the original stat block and surrounding commentary, then write a few sentences about the creature. Then convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.

Take for example this OSR creature:

#### Foxwoman
Can take the form of a fox, a woman, or a 7' tall fox-headed.  
HD d8 HP HDx4 Speed 120' Armor 14 Morale 11 Attack: +4 d8hp (claw, bite or choke)
- Defense: Cannot be harmed by metal
- Special: Can transform into a fox or a maiden with one fox leg hidden (same stats) at will

_**Using the example above, I can see that she:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Looking at the stats, it seems like she doesn't have too high HP, and she's quite fast.
- Agile and lithe.
- Attacks with deadly teeth and claws (choking her prey if possible).
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to metal weapons.


_**This tells me:**_  
- She's fast, and probably savvy in a fight. She probably has higher than average Hit Protection (regular humans have 3 HP). **6 HP**.
- I don't think foxes have protective hides, and she's otherwise human beside her head. **No Armor**.
- She is decently strong. Normal human is 10 and she's bigger. **12 STR**
- I can imagine her hunting prey over the snowy tundra. She's fast. **14 DEX**
- Foxes are pretty cunning, right? Probably forceful and proactive in a tough situation. **11 WIL**
- I'd go with **bite (d6)** for the teeth attack, and **claws (d8+d8)**, the same as any two-handed weapon.

_**In summary, that leaves us with the following opening statblock:**_  
6 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)

_**Now on to her abilities:**_  
These are easy. Just copy the fictional stat block created earlier!
- We know what she looks like, and that she can transform into a fox at will.
- She cannot be harmed by metal; I'm taking this to mean she's immune to _metal weapons_.
- She chokes her victims.

_**Easy, right? Now to make it useful:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on.

_**And that's it!**_
_**Behold, a converted Cairn monster:**_

#### Foxwoman
6 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on.
