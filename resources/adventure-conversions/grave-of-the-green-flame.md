# Grave of the Green Flame
- Based on the [original adventure](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/315851/BX6-Grave-of-the-Green-Flame-BX-RPG) by Bill Barsh.
- Conversion by Ryan McCarthy

Note on critical damage: In the Cairn rules critical damage incapacitates the character. Since the player character is alone for most or all of this adventure, this critical damage rule can make it especially deadly. The player therefore has the option of suspending critical damage except in the case of certain monsters with special attacks (eg poison, blood drain). In those cases the special attack applies on a failed STR save, but the character is not automatically incapacitated.

Adventure Points- Start the adventure with 3 Adventure Points

Class specific choices- Several times in the adventure certain choices are made available only to characters of specific class (ranger, thief, etc.) In Cairn any character with a relevant background may make these choices and need not make any rolls to do so (eg tracking always succeeds for a PC with a background like hunter or ranger).

Spell scrolls- Roll 1d100 on Cairn’s spell list to determine what spells are on any scrolls you acquire.
