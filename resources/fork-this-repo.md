3. Name the repo cairn-**lang**, e.g. cairn-fr for French, etc. Your repo should be called something like https://github.com/yourusername/cairn-lang.

4. Copy the translated markdown into the cairn-srd.md file.

5. Translate the other pages in the repo (readme, resources, etc).

6.  Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) to enable github pages on the new repo.
