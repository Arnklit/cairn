## You Get

A lantern, a flask of lamp oil, a quarter staff.

## Why Did You Stop Practicing?

1. **Lack of Talent:** The most advanced concoction you could come up with was salt water.  

2. **Heresy:** Local clergy found your theories and practices to be blasphemous. They confiscated your works and now you owe a minor indulgence to the church.  

3. **Exiled:** You accidentally brewed a love potion instead of the request routine salve. The subject was an heir to a local position of nobility, and their parent would rather see you dead than their offspring end up with you.  

4. **Hunted:** Somehow you created a homunculus, a small 6-inch replica of yourself. This creature hates you with every fiber of its being.  

5. **Betrayed**: You're pretty sure your mentor was slowly killing you with arsenic. Every once in a while you'll find yourself in a vomiting fit.  

6. **Accident:** The last concoction you brewed resulted in a massive explosion, scarring you horribly, and burning down a significant portion of home village, many of whom will never forgive you.

## What Were You Able To Make Away With?

1. **Alchemist's Fire:** a clay bottle filled with sticky green fluid that catches fire when exposed to air. Counts a bottle of burning oil without needing to lit.  

2. **Bomb:** Head-sized iron ball filled with explosive powder with an attached wick. Deals d12 damage to everyone nearby it, and can cause noteworthy damage to structures it is placed nearby.  

3. **Vial of Acid:** Can disintegrate 1 cubic inch of any kind of metal. If used as a splash weapon, the target must pass a save or suffer -1 to Charisma if applied to the face, -1 Dexterity if applied to a limb, or -1 Constitution if applied to the torso.  

4. **Tincture Of Truth-Talking:** Only a few drops remain, enough for one dose. This tasteless clear liquid will compel whoever ingests it to answer questions truthfully for d6 \* 10 minutes.  

5. **Magnesium Shavings**: A pouch containing d6 uses that will easily ignite and burn intensely.  

6. **Basic Alchemist's Kit:** A wooden chest filled with four corked glass vials and stand, a small bronze weight scale, pestle & mortar, stirring rods, a bottle of solvent, and a pouch of salt.
