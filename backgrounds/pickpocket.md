# You get

One nasty dagger, a pouch full of buttons, a tooth pick.

# How were you caught?

1. **Lack of Finesse:** Turns out walking right up to someone, holding direct eye contact, and shoving your hands straight into their pockets and purses is a great way to be immediately arrested.
2. **Mini Man Alarm:** Bit by a pocket homunculus, your yelps gave you away.
3. **Outplayed:** Your last mark was a master counter-thief, every pence you thought you took from them somehow ended with every last thing you owned being transferred to them.
4. **Betrayed:** One of your companions pointed you out to the sheriff, who used your capture as a feather in their cap.
5. **Loud Mouthed:** After buying several rounds of ales, a stranger asked you how you came upon such good fortunes. You quickly learned that honesty is not always the best policy.
6. **Divination:** After retiring from a career of adventuring, the local hedge mage decided to become a village detective.

# What was the oddest thing you lifted?

1. **Tiny Totem of Confidence:** A figure of a local deity carved from smooth stone, when it belly is rubbed you can hear affirmations in your head.
2. **Digestible Treasure:** One purse full of imitation coins, the gold nothing but foil. The chocolate internals at least is a rare treat.
3. **Psychedelic Mold:** The leather purse your stole from a visiting druid contained only patches of moist growth inside. Ingesting this made you acutely aware of the secret lives of colors and the varies polyhedral shapes living in-between wood grains.
4. **Pouch of Devouring:** Fanged on the inside, this bag whines if not provided with a weekly meal. Seemingly able to digest all sorts of organic and inorganic material you can it into it without producing waste. Or at least, without producing waste _as of yet_.
5. **Monster Teeth:** Unsettlingly, the local miller had a purse practically bursting with a variety of fangs, teeth, and claws. You are unsure if you should report them to someone, or if you can use these in some kind of ritual.
6. **Lovely Lich's Locket:** Unsure who it belonged to, but someone in your village kept a heart-shaped locket with a rendition of the Dread Lich Pestulentia. Can you use this to your advantage?
