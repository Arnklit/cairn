# GLOG Magic Hack
---

- You carry a **Grimoire** worth 300gp. It is [bulky](cairn-srd/#inventory), and contains a single random spell.
- You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to available inventory slots. This is referred to as your **Casting Pool**.
- See this [**list of GLOG Spells**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTVy-5Vm44xhRmFO4tKFCJto-_cw0xYtD8lNj8AsSJY/view?pli=1).
- Treat all Spellbooks as [Scrolls](/hacks/glog-magic/#scrolls).

### Casting Spells:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**. They may denote range with **R** and duration with **D**.
2. Choose how many **MD** from your **Casting Pool** you want to invest into the spell. The number of dice will be referenced with [dice]. Certain Spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
3. Roll [dice]. Any that show 1-3 return to your **Casting Pool** for future spell  Any that show a 4-6 are removed from play, and you gain one [**Fatigue**](/cairn-srd/#rules) for each.

### **Example**
_**Barry** has 4 free inventory slots, giving him 4 **MD**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image** (see below), and decides to invest 2 of his **MD**. That means he can create two duplicates that last for two minutes. He rolls: a 2 and a 5. He gains one **Fatigue**, and 1 **MD** returns to his pool, with **3** remaining._

### [ **Mirror Images** ]

|                                 ||
| ------------------------------- ||
| D: [dice] minutes | R: Self |

Creates [dice] duplicates of you, which overlap with you and confuse attackers. Any time youâ€™re attacked, the attack has an equal chance to hit you or any of your images. If an image is hit, it is destroyed.

### Advanced Rules

#### **Scrolls**
Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after a single use. Otherwise, they work exactly the same as spells recorded in your **Grimoire**.

#### **Copying Spells**
You may copy spells found in Scrolls to your **Grimoire**. This costs 50gp for the gold inks and takes 6 hours to complete, reduced by [sum] hours. The Spellbook is destroyed in the process.

##### **Creating a Grimoire**
Creating a **Grimoire** is time-consuming and expensive. You will need:
- A single Scroll which is sacrificed through the process.
- 200gp in inks.
- 6 hours in the light of a full moon.

The spell contained within the Scroll will become the first recorded spell.
