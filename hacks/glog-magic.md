# GLOG Magic Hack
---
To use [GLOG Magic](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-glog-wizards.html) spells in Cairn, consider the following player rules:
- You carry a **Grimoire** worth 300gp. It is [bulky](cairn-srd/#inventory), and contains a single [random spell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTVy-5Vm44xhRmFO4tKFCJto-_cw0xYtD8lNj8AsSJY/view?pli=1).
- You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to available [inventory slots](cairn-srd/#inventory).
- Treat all Spellbooks as [Scrolls](/hacks/glog-magic/#scrolls).

**Note:**  
These rules are _not_ intended as "drop-in" toolbox for casting GLOG spells. There are no magic mishaps in Cairn, and most spells are simply tools.

### Casting Spells:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**. They may denote the spell's duration with **D** and range with **R**.
2. Choose how many **MD** you want to invest into the spell. Spells will refer to these as [dice]. Some spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
3. Roll [dice]. A die that shows a result of 4-6 is removed from play and you gain one [**Fatigue**](/cairn-srd/#rules) for each.

### **Example**
_**Barry** has 4 free inventory slots, giving him 4 **MD**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image** (see below), and decides to invest 2 of his **MD**. That means he can create two duplicates that last for two minutes. He rolls: a 2 and a 5. He gains one **Fatigue**, and 1 **MD** returns to his pool, with **3** remaining._

### [ **Mirror Images** ]

|                            ||
| ---------------------------||
| D: [dice] minutes | R: Self |

_Creates [dice] duplicates of you, which overlap with you and confuse attackers. Any time youâ€™re attacked, the attack has an equal chance to hit you or any of your images. If an image is hit, it is destroyed._

## Advanced Rules

### **Scrolls**
- Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after a single use. Otherwise, they work exactly the same as spells recorded in your **Grimoire**.

### **Copying Spells**
You may copy spells found in Scrolls to your **Grimoire**. This costs 50gp for the gold inks and takes 6 hours to complete, reduced by [sum] hours. The Scroll is destroyed in the process.

### **Creating a Grimoire**
Creating a **Grimoire** is time-consuming and expensive. You will need:
- A single Scroll, which is sacrificed through the process.
- 200gp in inks, as well as a blank book.
- 6 hours in the light of a full moon. You can invest reduced by [sum] hours.
- The spell contained within the Scroll will become the first recorded spell.


## Optional Mishaps Rules
These optional rules make magic more dangerous.
- Rolling doubles generates a Mishap.
- Rolling triples generates a Doom.
