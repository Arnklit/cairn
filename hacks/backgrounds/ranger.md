## Why did you abandon your lands? Roll 1d6:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Service** | You left your homelands for the military, and the glint of freedom & comradery it promised. You now know that was all a lie. Recently freed you from your duties, you range alone once more. Take a lead shooter (d6, blast). It takes a full round to reload. |
| 2    |**Injury** | You lost a limb doing something valiant, but also stupidly dangerous. You survived, but at the cost of something dear to you. Before you left, you received an unmarked gift: an alchemical limb (d8). It works almost as well as the real thing, and is immune to poison, fire and heat. Sometimes it jams. |
| 3    | **Displaced**| "Civilized" folk claimed your ancestral lands as their own, and backed their claims with force and advanced technology. You left, but not without claiming something for yourself first. Take an Ice Seed. It freezes any water it is dropped in. Once the water melts, the seed reforms. Don't eat it. |
| 4    | **Shiftless**| You were wronged, and for years sought revenge. Now that you have it you don't know what to do with yourself. In your boredom you've taken up other interests. Choose a second background, but do not roll on the subsequent table. |
| 5    |**Vanquished**| You failed to protect your lands against a raging blight. Defeated, you left to find new lands to range. Take a seed wrenched from the roots of your forest's final dying tree. It awaits the chance to be planted once more.|     
| 6    |****|      |

## Who is always at your side? Roll 1d6:

|      |                          |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **** |  |
| 2    | **False Boomerang** | This heavily-weathered boomerang not only does not return to you, but seems to travel unerringly in a straight line forever until it crashes into something. You've been worried you're going to lose it if you throw it towards the sky. |
| 3    | **Bear Suit**  | The entire furs of a person-sized bear, treated and stitched to be wearable. Its a bit hard to see out of the beast's snout, but not the worst disguise from afar. On a foggy day. While situated among the brush. When trying to hide from someone with poor vision. |
| 4    | **Game Spookers** | A very weighty round brass bell. Toss into a bush to scare out any game, or to dangle upon your walking stick to give yourself your own entrance music. |
| 5    | **Snare Kit**| A heavy canvas sack filled with all manner of traps - iron teeth, lassos, ropes, nets, counter weights, snares, etc. |
| 6    | **Salts & Spices** | A very fine wooden box filled with tubes and pouches of uncommon spices, treating salts, fancy woods. Suitable for preserving small game or adding a bit of pizazz to a campfire meal. |
