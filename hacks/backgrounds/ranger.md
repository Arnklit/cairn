# Ranger

## Starting Gear

- 3d6 gold pieces
- Three daysâ€™ rations
- Torches (2)
- Tent (bulky, fits 2)
- Shortsword (d6)
- Boiled leather (1 Armor)

## Why did you abandon your lands? Roll 1d6:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**** |      |
| 2    |**** |      |
| 3    | **Displaced**  | "Civilized" folk claimed your ancestral lands as their own, and backed their claims with force and advanced technology. You left, but not without claiming something for yourself first. Take an Ice Seed. It freezes any water it is dropped in. Once it melts, the seed reforms. Don't eat it.  |
| 4    | **Shiftless**  | You were wronged, and for years sought revenge. Now that you have it you don't know what to do with yourself. In your boredom you've taken up other interests. Choose a second background, but do not roll on the subsequent table.  |
| 5    |**Overstepped** |      |
| 6    |**Vanquished**| You failed to protect your lands against a raging blight. Defeated, you left to find new lands to range. Take a seed wrenched from the roots of your forest's final dying tree. It awaits the chance to be planted once more.|     

## Which wind carried your spirit into this world?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Dawn** | You're most alert at first light, and rarely require breakfast. You do not become deprived after missing a first day's rations (Fatigue rules still apply).      |
| 2    |**Morning** | You've learned the calls of birds, and how to reproduce them. Take a wooden whistle. |
| 3    |**Afternoon** |     |
| 5    |**Dusk** |      |
| 4    |**Evening** |      |
| 6    |**Midnight** | You don't need as much sleep as the others. Once per day you can lose a single Fatigue without having to rest. |
