## Why did you abandon your lands? Roll 1d6:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**** |      |
| 2    |**** |      |
| 3    |**** |      |
| 4    |**** |      |
| 5    |**Overstepped** |      |
| 6    |**Vanquished**| You failed to protect your lands against a raging blight. Defeated, you left to find new lands to range. Take a seed wrenched from the roots of your forest's final dying tree. It awaits the chance to be planted once more.|     

## Which wind carried your spirit into this world?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Dawn** | You're most alert at first light, and rarely require breakfast. You do not become deprived after missing a first day's rations (Fatigue rules still apply).      |
| 2    |**Morning** | You've learned the calls of birds, and how to reproduce them. Take a wooden whistle. |
| 3    |**Afternoon** |     |
| 5    |**Dusk** |      |
| 4    |**Evening** |      |
| 6    |**Midnight** | You don't need as much sleep as the others. Once per day you can lose a single Fatigue without having to rest. |
