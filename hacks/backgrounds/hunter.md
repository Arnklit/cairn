## Why did you abandon the hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |                   |                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Offended** | Tracking and killing your quarry in new territory, you unwillingly enraged a local spirit. Enraged, it cursed you with the ability to experience the fear of any nearby creature. You are now an excellent tracker, but cannot bring yourself to hunt. |
| 2    | **Disgraced**  | You privately confronted a respected elder about their misdeeds and were rudely dismissed. After nearly losing your head to a crossbow bolt, you broke all ties and fled. Before you left you grabbed the elder's prized talisman (_Ward_ once per day). They want it back.|
| 3    | **Remorseful**  | During the _Great Hunt_ you neglected to warn the hunting party of an imminent attack, and an important person was killed. Ashamed, you left the life you knew, taking a Thundering Horn as a reminder of your dereliction in duty. |
| 4    | **Displaced**  | "Civilized" folk claimed your ancestral lands as their own, and backed their claims with force and advanced technology. You left, but not without claiming something for yourself first. Take an Ice Seed. It freezes any water it is dropped in. Once it melts, the seed reforms. Don't eat it.  |
| 5    | **Shiftless**  | You were wronged, and for years sought revenge. Now that you have it you don't know what to do with yourself. In your boredom you've taken up other interests. Choose a second background, but do not roll on the subsequent table.  |
| 6    | **Beliefs** | After a close-call with a Horror of the Night, you became stained with conviction.  You have adopted a strict code of ethics to only kill that which eats people, and to never eat flesh again. You became a slayer of monsters, wandering towards wherever you feel you are needed. Take a Silver Sword (d8). The damage is (d8+d8) against creatures that have tasted the flesh of your kind. |
