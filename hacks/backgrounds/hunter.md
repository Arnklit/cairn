## Why did you abandon the hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |                   |                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Dire Consequences** | Tracking and killing your quarry in new territory, you unwillingly enraged a local spirit. Enraged, it cursed you with the ability to experience the fear of any nearby creature. You are now an excellent tracker, but cannot bring yourself to hunt. |
| 2    | **Disgrace**  | You privately confronted a respected elder about their misdeeds and were rudely dismissed. After nearly losing your head to a crossbow bolt, you broke all ties and fled. Besides you left you grabbed the elder's prized **Spirit Ward**, (_Ward_ once per day). They want it back.|
| 3    | **Remorse**  | During the _Great Hunt_ you neglected to warn the hunting party of an imminent attack, and an important person was killed. Ashamed, you left the life you knew, taking a Thundering Horn as a reminder of your dereliction in duty. |
| 4    | **Forced Out**  | "Civilized" folk claimed your ancestral lands as their own, and backed their claims with force and advanced technology. You left, but not with claiming something of theirs first. Take a **Falconer's Friend**, 1 charge. It carries the _Haste_ spell. Fire from a crossbow to recharge.  |
| 5    | **Wizard's Laughter** | You didn't mean to kill the village's most-loved and kindest-hearted wizened old sage. You had no idea they polymorphed themselves into wildlife to go frolic in the woods. |
| 6    | **Haunting**   | The dooming blight that has choked many lands has reached your ranges, littering the once peaceful groves with hungry ghosts. |

## What beast is always at your side?
