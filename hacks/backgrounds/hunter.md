## Why did you abandon the hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |                   |                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Wrath** | Tracking and killing your quarry in new territory, you unwillingly enraged a local spirit. Enraged, it cursed you with the ability to experience the fear of any nearby creature. You are now an excellent tracker, but cannot bring yourself to hunt. |
| 2    | **Disgrace**  | You privately confronted a respected elder about their misdeeds and were rudely dismissed. After nearly losing your head to a crossbow bolt, you broke all ties and fled. Before you left you grabbed the elder's prized talisman (_Ward_ once per day). They want it back.|
| 3    | **Remorse**  | During the _Great Hunt_ you neglected to warn the hunting party of an imminent attack, and an important person was killed. Ashamed, you left the life you knew, taking a Thundering Horn as a reminder of your dereliction in duty. |
| 4    | ****  | |
| 5    | ****  | |
| 6    | **Touched** | After a close-call with a Horror of the Night, you became instilled by conviction.  You have adopted a strict code of ethics to only kill that which eats people, and to never eat flesh again. You became a slayer of monsters, wandering towards wherever you feel you are needed. Take a Silver Sword (d8). The damage is (d8+d8) against creatures that have tasted the flesh of your kind. |

## Which wind carried your spirit into this world?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Dawn** | You're most alert at first light, and rarely require breakfast. You do not become deprived after missing a first day's rations (Fatigue rules still apply).      |
| 2    |**Morning** | You've learned the calls of birds, and how to reproduce them. Take a wooden whistle. |
| 3    |**Afternoon** |     |
| 5    |**Dusk** |      |
| 4    |**Evening** |      |
| 6    |**Midnight** | You don't need as much sleep as the others. Once per day you can lose a single Fatigue without having to rest. |
