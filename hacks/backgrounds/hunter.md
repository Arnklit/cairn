## Why did you abandon the hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |                   |                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Wrath** | Tracking and killing your quarry in new territory, you unwillingly enraged a local spirit. Enraged, it cursed you with the ability to experience the fear of any nearby creature. You are now an excellent tracker, but cannot bring yourself to hunt. |
| 2    | **Disgrace**  | You privately confronted a respected elder about their misdeeds and were rudely dismissed. After nearly losing your head to a crossbow bolt, you broke all ties and fled. Before you left you grabbed the elder's prized talisman (_Ward_ once per day). They want it back.|
| 3    | **Remorse**  | During the _Great Hunt_ you neglected to warn the hunting party of an imminent attack, and an important person was killed. Ashamed, you left the life you knew, taking a Thundering Horn as a reminder of your dereliction in duty. |
| 4    | ****  | |
| 5    | ****  | |
| 6    | **Touched** | After a close-call with a Horror of the Night, you were instilled with conviction.  You have adopted a strict code of ethics to only kill that which eats people, and to never eat flesh again. You became a slayer of monsters, wandering towards wherever you feel you are needed. Take a Silver Sword (d8). The damage is (d8+d8) against creatures that have tasted the flesh of your kind. |

## Which wind carried your spirit into this world?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Dawn** | You're most alert at first light, and rarely require breakfast. You do not become deprived after missing a first day's rations (Fatigue rules still apply). |
| 2    |**Morning** | You've learned the calls of birds, and how to bend them to your will. Take a young falcon (3 HP, 3 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, claws (d6), follows simple whistle commands) Occasionally it bites you. |
| 3    |**Day** | You are a skilled rider. While mounted, your attacks are enhanced against unmounted combatants. Take an old nag from the plains (+2 slots, fast enough). |
| 4   |**Afternoon** | You learned to hunt alongside dogs, tracking your prey by smell and blood alone. Your bloodhound (2 HP, 12 DEX, bite (d6)) is never far away, and responds to even your most subtle cues.|
| 5    |**Dusk** | Your people stalked large deer and elk through tundra and forest, never staying in one place for more than a few hours. You don't need as much sleep as most; once per day you can lose a single Fatigue without having to rest. You cannot be surprised upon waking. |
| 6    |**Midnight** |  |
