## Why did you abandon the hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |                   |                                                              |

| 1    | **Wrath** | Tracking and killing your quarry in new territory, you unwillingly enraged a local spirit. Enraged, it cursed you with the ability to experience the fear of any nearby creature. You are now an excellent tracker, but cannot bring yourself to hunt. |
| 2    | **Disgrace**  | You privately confronted a respected elder about their misdeeds and were rudely dismissed. After nearly losing your head to a crossbow bolt, you broke all ties and fled. Before you left you grabbed the elder's prized talisman (_Ward_ once per day). They want it back.|
| 3    | **Remorse**  | During the _Great Hunt_ you neglected to warn the hunting party of an imminent attack, and an important person was killed. Ashamed, you left the life you knew, taking a Thundering Horn as a reminder of your dereliction in duty. |
| 4    | ****  | |
| 5    | ****  | |
| 6    | **Touched** | After a close-call with a Horror of the Night, you became instilled by conviction.  You have adopted a strict code of ethics to only kill that which eats people, and to never eat flesh again. You became a slayer of monsters, wandering towards wherever you feel you are needed. Take a Silver Sword (d8). The damage is (d8+d8) against creatures that have tasted the flesh of your kind. |

## Who is always at your side?

|      |                          |                                                              |

| 1    | **** |  |
| 2    | **False Boomerang** | This heavily-weathered boomerang not only does not return to you, but seems to travel unerringly in a straight line forever until it crashes into something. You've been worried you're going to lose it if you throw it towards the sky. |
| 3    | **Bear Suit**  | The entire furs of a person-sized bear, treated and stitched to be wearable. Its a bit hard to see out of the beast's snout, but not the worst disguise from afar. On a foggy day. While situated amongst the brush. When trying to hide from someone with poor vision. |
| 4    | **Game Spookers**        | A very weighty round brass bell. Toss into a bush to scare out any game, or to dangle upon your walking stick to give yourself your own entrance music. |
| 5    | **Snare Kit**            | A heavy canvas sack filled with all manner of traps - iron teeth, lassos, ropes, nets, counter weights, snares, etc. |
| 6    | **Salts & Spices**       | A very fine wooden box filled with tubes and pouches of uncommon spices, treating salts, fancy woods. Suitable for preserving small game or adding a bit of pizazz to a campfire meal. |
