## You get

A dagger, well-kept leather shoes, a dark wool cloak.

## Professional burglary is no longer part of your life, why?

1. **Judged:** The last time you were caught they took an ear, next time you'll probably be executed.
2. **Reformed:** The Acolytes of Law convinced you that your actions brought unholy Chaos into the world. Now you seek to pay for your past transgressions.
3. **Cursed:** Rumors that the last house you breeched were a witch's hut were entirely true. Now when you sleep you have dreams of that house being hoisted on dozens of legs, crawling ever towards you.
4. **Soured:** While out robbing another, you returned to find your home had been burgled. Having tasted your own medicine you found it very bitter, and resolved to leave it behind.
5. **Pursued:** A bounty has been put on your head. You hope to find lands where no one recognizes you, or to earn enough gold to perhaps repay your crimes.
6. **Bungled:** You just were never good at it - you were continually caught in the act, assaulted by your targets, repeatedly found yourself having to make escaped by leaping into manure piles. Maybe adventuring will be different?

## What was the most outstanding thing you stole?

1. **Lucky Coin:** This coin seems to always land the side you intend upwards.
2. **Monkey's Paw:** An unattached paw of a money. When something is placed in its palm the fingers wrap around the object with an unbreakable grip. Squeezing the wrist stump causes the hand to release its grip.
3. **Fossilized Legend:** A palm-sized hunk of amber containing the miniature skeleton of a winged serpent.
4. **Makani's Magnificent Messaging Cube:** An elaborately-decorate cube with a removable lid. Retains one sentence spoken into it, and will replay the exact wording in the speaker's voice once when opened.
5. **Coin-Purse of Copper Conversion:** A peculiar leather purse that will immediately convert any coin or gems placed within to copper, bearing the markings or minting of the region that the owner is currently within.
6. **Suspicious Song Bird:** A cage containing one warbler that will begin chirping when in the presence of a statement that is unlikely to be true.
