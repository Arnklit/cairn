## Why Did You Stop Being an Herbalist? Roll 1d6:

|      |                 |                                                              |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Tormented**   | You (accidentally?) stole the heart-seed of a cantankerous forest spirit; it still hounds you. Until such time as the spirit's ire is sated anything you plant will wilt and die. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. It can cure any wound, and even reverse death. One use. |
| 2    | **Haunted**     | You were witness to the death of a childhood playmate. You've recently been seeing their face in any teas you brew. They only speak of death - theirs and yours. Take a soporific. You're quite good at making them, now.  |
| 3    | **Devil's Bargain**   | You spent years studying plants and herbs, hoping to find a cure for your constant allergies. You were successful, but paid a great price: the loss of taste and smell. Take an authoritative book on dangerous plants.  |
| 4    | **Cross-pollination**    | Your experiments were radical, crossing boundaries you were never meant to surpass. You used yourself as a test subject, with dire consequences. You do not eat; the Sun provides enough nutrients, provided its rays reach you often enough. Instead of rations, you carry a jug of water.  |
| 5    | **Deadly Consequences** | The local nobility sponsored a grand competition between all the greatest herbalists, florists and gardeners. Your corpse-flower won the show. Unfortunately, it also killed one of the judges. Take the grand prize: 25gp, and the hatred of nearly everyone. |
| 6    | **Fall From Grace**    | Your restorative tinctures were known all through the lands, bringing you fame and fortune. That is of course until it was discovered that one of the side-effects was infertility. Take a healing potion; drinking restores all STR. You know the cost, though.    |

## What did you take with you?

|      |                       |                                                              |

| 1    | **Amadou**            | A peculiar kind of fungus that catches flame quite easily. You have about 6 uses worth. |
| 2    | **Cat's Nip**         | You keep this in a tightly-sealed bottle, but when you sprinkle even a pinch of it, a dozen or so local cats will find their way to it, and nearly any feline will be rendered catatonic for nearly an hour after getting a taste. You have about ten pinches remaining. |
| 3    | **Tacky Stalk**       | This woody reed contains a fibrous, chalky interior that may be chewed into a gummy mound. After a few minutes this mound will harden entirely, becoming a permanent adhesive after drying. |
| 4    | **Artifical Flowers** | You're not completely sure what this is, but it seems to be a bouquet fashioned out of felt, wax, wire and other materials. It looks real as long as it is not closely observed, and is rather resplendent. |
| 5    | **Seed Bomb**         | You have three dirt clods held together in small canvas sacks. Their contents will explode on impact, showering whatever they strike with dirt and a multitude of seeds, dizzying anyone struck, and with a bit of rain will produce a patch of wildflowers in a week or so. |
| 6    | **Mandrake**          | small root that looks somewhat like a tiny human. This being follows you about, telling you jokes and laughing in its shrill, high pitched voice. After spending months with the thing you're not sure its so bad that you cannot speak Mandrake. |
