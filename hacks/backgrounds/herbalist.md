## Why Did You Stop Being an Herbalist? Roll 1d6:

|      |                 |                                                              |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Tormented**   | You (accidentally?) stole the heart-seed of a cantankerous forest spirit; it still hounds you. Until such time as the spirit's ire is sated anything you plant will wilt and die. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. It can cure any wound, and even reverse death. One use. |
| 2    | **Haunted**     | You bore witness to the death of a close friend. Recently, you've been seeing their face in any teas you brew. They only speak of death; both theirs and yours. Take a soporific. You're quite good at making them, now.  |
| 3    | **Devil's Bargain**   | You spent years studying plants and herbs, hoping to find the cure for a life-long affliction. You were successful, but paid a great price: the loss of both your taste and smell. You can handle noxious fumes better than most. Take an authoritative book on dangerous plants.  |
| 4    | **Cross-pollination**    | Your experiments were radical, crossing boundaries you were never meant to surpass. You used yourself as a test subject, with dire consequences. You do not eat; the Sun provides enough nutrients, provided its rays reach you often enough. Instead of rations, you carry a jug of water.  |
| 5    | **Deadly Consequences** | The local nobility sponsored a grand competition between all the greatest herbalists, florists and gardeners. Your corpse-flower won the show. Unfortunately, it also killed one of the judges. Take the grand prize: 25gp, and the hatred of nearly everyone. |
| 6    | **Fall From Grace**    | Your restorative tinctures were known all through the lands, bringing you fame and fortune. That is of course until it was discovered that one of the side-effects was infertility. Take a healing potion; drinking restores all STR. You know the cost, though.    |

## What Did You Take With You? Roll 1d6:

|      |                       |                                                              |

| 1    | **Amadou**            | A peculiar kind of fungus that catches flame quite easily. You have about 6 uses worth. |
| 2    | **Delphinium**        | A gray, concentrated elixir that allows the drinker the ability to hold their breath for up to an hour. It can be divided into multiple doses.  |
| 3    | **Tacky Stalk**       | This woody reed contains a fibrous, chalky interior that may be chewed into a gummy mound. After a few minutes this mound will harden entirely, becoming a permanent adhesive after drying. It spreads well. |
| 4    | **Artificial Flowers** | A bouquet fashioned out of felt, wax, wire and other materials. It looks real as long as it is not closely observed, and is rather resplendent. Its odor resembles that of the person's favorite flower. |
| 5    | **Seed Bomb**         | Three dirt clods held tightly together in small canvas sacks. Their contents explodes on impact, showering their target with dirt and a multitude of seeds. |
| 6    | **Duda**          | A small root that looks somewhat like a tiny, sleepy human. At first it fits snugly into your backpack, but comes alive when splashed with a bit of milk. Tell it where you (and only you) want to go, and suddenly you'll find yourself there. Each time it wakes it grows by a factor of two. |
