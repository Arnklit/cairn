# GLOG Magic Hack

Spellbooks do not exist. Only your **Grimoire**, which takes up two slots in inventory.
You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to empty spots in your inventory. This is called your **Casting Pool**.

To cast a spell:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**.
2. Choose how many **MD** from your Casting Pool you want to invest into the spell. The number of dice will be referenced with "[dice]."
3. Roll the invested [dice]. Certain spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
4. [Dice] that show 1-3 return to your casting pool for future spells.
5. [Dice] that show a 4-6 are removed from play, and you gain one **Fatigue** for each.

Scrolls exist, and

## Example
**Mirror Image**

You create 1d4+{dice] illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and always stay within 5' of you. They are constantly stepping through each other, so that it is impossible to tell which is which. When an enemy attacks you, roll to see if they hit you or an image. An image vanishes as soon as it
suffers a solid impact (a blow from a mace, but also a slap). Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to instantly vanish (and you'll take fire breath damage, naturally).
