# GLOG Magic Hack
---

You carry a **Grimoire**, which takes up two slots in inventory.
You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to empty spots in your inventory. This is called your **Casting Pool**.

### Casting Spells:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**. They may denote range with **R** and duration with **D**.
2. Choose how many **MD** from your **Casting Pool** you want to invest into the spell. The number of dice will be referenced with [dice]. Certain Spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
3. Roll [dice]. Any that show 1-3 return to your **Casting Pool** for future Spells. Any that show a 4-6 are removed from play, and you gain one [**Fatigue**](/cairn-srd/#rules) for each.

#### Spellbooks
You may copy spells found in Spellbooks to this **Grimoire** by [figure this out later].


#### Scrolls
Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after use. You may invest magic dice to enhance a Spell.
