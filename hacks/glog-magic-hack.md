# GLOG Magic Hack
---

- You carry a **Grimoire**, which takes up two slots in inventory.
- You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to remaining available inventory slots. This is referred to as your **Casting Pool**.
- See this [**list of GLOG Spells**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTVy-5Vm44xhRmFO4tKFCJto-_cw0xYtD8lNj8AsSJY/view?pli=1)

### Casting Spells:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**. They may denote range with **R** and duration with **D**.
2. Choose how many **MD** from your **Casting Pool** you want to invest into the spell. The number of dice will be referenced with [dice]. Certain Spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
3. Roll [dice]. Any that show 1-3 return to your **Casting Pool** for future spell  Any that show a 4-6 are removed from play, and you gain one [**Fatigue**](/cairn-srd/#rules) for each.

#### **Spellbooks**
You may copy spells found in Spellbooks to this **Grimoire** by [figure this out later].

#### **Scrolls**
Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after use. You may invest magic dice to enhance a spell [figure this out later].

#### **Example**
_**Barry** has 4 free inventory slots, giving him 4 **MD**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image** (see below), and decides to invest 2 of his **MD**. That means he can create two duplicates that last for two minutes. He rolls: a 2 and a 5. He gains one **Fatigue**, and 1 **MD** returns to his pool, with **3** remaining._

### [ **Mirror Images** ]
