# Yet Another Hexcrawl Procedure
- Converted from [Yet Another Hexcrawl Procedure](https://dangerisreal.blogspot.com/2021/08/yet-another-hexcrawl-procedure-there-is.html), with permission.
- Based on [Wilderness Adventuring](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Wilderness_Adventuring) for [Old School Essentials](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272802/OldSchool-Essentials-Basic-Rules).
- This assumes the classic 1 HEX = 6 miles = +/- 10 km but it works with any size.
- Roll for **Weather** once at the start of each day on your favorite table. Example [here](https://ynasmidgard.blogspot.com/2019/02/simple-seasonal-weather-table.html) or [here](https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/weather/).

## Watches
The day is divided into 3 watches of _roughly 8 hours_ each:
- **Early watch** (+/- 6 am -> 2 pm)
- **Late watch** (+/- 2 pm -> 10 pm)
- **Night watch** (+/- 10 pm -> 6pm)

### For each watch, the party can take one action:

#### Travel
##### The party travels through hexes.
  - Progress up to half of daily travel distance
  - all obvious locations/features and the terrain type of neighboring hexes are revealed accordingly to sight distance.
  - Check for losing direction.
  - Roll on the Event Table

#### Explore
##### The party search for hidden features within the current hex.
  - One Location/Feature is discovered.
  - Roll on the Event Table.

#### Supply
##### The party is gathering food and water
  - Hunting and foraging
  - Roll on the Event Table.

#### Camp
##### The party stops to set up camp.
  - Each member removes 1 fatigue slot (if any)
  - Roll on the **Event Table**.

#### Interact
##### The party interacts with a location/feature
  - Dungeon delving, town/village adventure, lair exploration, long NPC interaction, etc...

#### Fatigue
Every night the party skips **Camp** or each watch they do a **forced march** they get a fatigue slot
