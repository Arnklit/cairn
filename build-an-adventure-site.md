# Build An Adventure Site
---

## Themes:
- Pick a theme for the area. A specific mythology you find inpiring, something from history, etc.
- Name (should reflect or theme). Some help [here](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/forest_names.php).
- Come up with a premise; typically an amazing location with a treasure to hunt.
- Dangers, Stakes, Motives, Urgency.
- Ruling faction (if applicable) with trait(s) & motives; add some kind of counter balance (enemies or pre-existing/hidden faction).

## Spark Tables
[Spark Tables](https://www.bastionland.com/2017/11/electric-modernity-and-spark-tables.html) are very handy tools for quickly creating a setting. They are typically made of 40 words divided into two columns. For an example Spark Table see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3E3FsQVvjqAMVcDIVXXQmo9g6bH0fQBDbzRJ6K5F10/edit#gid=0). There are four tables there. With some light editing, they result in phrases like:  
- Digesting Claws
- White Eyes
- Distorted Tongues
- Predatory Awakening
- Grimalkin Fungi
- Nourishing Deep
- Paranoia Underbrush
- Mouth-less Cemetery
- Withering Hue
- Subterranean Ripple
- Transmutation Sparrows
- Moonlight Trees
- Mildew Gloom
- Smoldering Shade


### Creating a Spark Table
To create a Spark Table, you'll want to find a find a book or website close to your adventure's overall theme (e.g. a PDF with related content). You can pull words from it by simply picking a random page and writing down whatever meets your eye, or you can import it into a web-based tool. You can also import [public domain books](https://archive.org/details/texts) on relevant subjects. [WordCounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/website-word-count) can create lists of non-common keywords from a website. You can then copy and paste those words into a spreadsheet.

Alternatively, you can create [Word Clouds](https://coolinfographics.com/word-clouds). You can copy and paste whole paragraphs or (depending on the book's copyright, of course) the entire PDF.

You can of course simply write down 40 words that sound good together.

When you've finished:  
- Clean up the words. Sort by d20 in two columns.
- Images can also serve as sparks.
- You'll want to generate at least 10 interesting phrases for inspiration.  

## A map of a area:
- Draw at least four lines of any shape, each from a different color. Each line should cross another at least once. These lines represent roads or paths.
- Generate at least 3 Points of Interest: from tables; take in consideration the theme(s) and factions. Put these wherever the lines cross.
- Generate regional/hex features for each POI using tables and placing results in those POIs where it makes most sense.
- Place additional (especially hidden) dangers, encounters or NPCâ€™s in some of the POI.
- Add some travel/route complications, taking in consideration any POIs along the way.
- Detailed notes with additional info, including:
- Encounter table (1d6/2d6), with at least one result tied to the party or its members.
- Details on any treasure or relics (Who wants it? Where is it now? Why wasn't it ransacked before?), including maps.
- Notes describing rooms for a dungeon (one sentence describing obstacles, hazards, creatures or minor treasure).

## Generating Treasure:
- Spark Tables, [Maze Rats](https://questingbeast.itch.io/maze-rats), [Adventuresmith](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.steavesea.adventuresmith&hl=en_US&gl=US) or similar will help greatly here.
- Roll on tables - generate stuff.
- Look on the map and think of who would want that.
- Look on the map and think of where it could be now.
- Add 2-3 steps leading up to that place, so it's not obvious and needs leads. Basically reverse engineering.
- Add some sort of "dungeon" in the place where the treasure resides.
- Stock "rooms" of a dungeon (additional treasure goes here)
