## Bonds

|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **d20** | **Bond**                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **1**   | A wise mentor taught you the ways of the Fae and the mortal world, hoping to bridge the gap between the two. Take a **handwritten journal** filled with their wisdom.                                |
| **2**   | A troubled spirit haunts the woods around your home village, refusing to rest until its death is avenged. Take a **fragment of glass** that always reflects the spirit's face.                       |
| **3**   | You promised a childhood friend that you'd bring them back a rare gift, something unique in all the world. Take a **bracelet** woven from twine and wildflowers.                                     |
| **4**   | A mysterious Fae lord has asked you to close a **Gate** in a field not far from your village. In return they will reveal your true parentage. Take a **sealed scroll** with the details of the task. |
| **5**   | A woodseer saved your life; in return you swore to protect **The Woods** from harm. Take an **acorn amulet** (1 Armor against forest magic) symbolizing your vow.                                    |
| **6**   | The **Dawn Brigade** did your family a service, giving you a dried blood-red flower as proof. If the flower turns white, it means the favor is owed.                                                 |
| **7**   | A former mentor is dying of a rare disease. The healing herbs they require are found only in **The Woods**, but are dangerous to acquire. Take a **waterproof pouch**.                               |
| **8**   | You protect a long-dormant family secret. Take one half of an **ancient key**. They that if joined with its twin, it opens a **Gate** through any door.                                              |
| **9**   | One of your ancestors wronged a moss witch, cursing their bloodline. Mirrors always break with your reflection, but its shards can reveal illusion.                                                  |
| **10**  | You trespassed on the **Wooded Dead's** sacred grove. To atone you must retrieve a corpsewood sapling. They grow in places populated only by the dead.                                               |
| **11**  | You carry a hand-drawn **portrait** of a past love who disappeared into **The Woods** long ago. Somehow, you know that they still alive.                                                             |
| **12**  | During your travels you met a dying hunter, who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a **letter**, sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the **Lord of Winter**.         |
| **13**  | A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take **20gp**, and an **ornate compass** that always points towards something deep in **The Woods**.                                                  |
| **14**  | An entertainer once visited your home, filling it with story and song. He left one day with hardly a note, leaving behind only **a miniature lute**. Something rattles inside.                       |
| **15**  |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **16**  | You freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some **silver moss**. Swallow it near water and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt.                                      |
| **17**  | You carved a **whistle** from an **Oak Lord's** branch. Your act did not go unnoticed. You cannot seem to rid yourself of the whistle.                                                               |
| **18**  | You came across an ancient **journal**, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly told by the journal itself.                                            |
| **19**  | You interrupted a Wood Nymph's noontime meal, but convinced him you'd return in three days' time with the best blackberry pie he'd ever tasted. It is not blackberry season.                         |
| **20**  |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |


## Omens

|        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|        | **Omens**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **d?** | Swarming pests gnaw away at the edges of your dreams, portending a grim future harvest. Farmers speak of a loud buzzing sound emanating from deep within The Woods.                                                                                                      |
| **1**  | The life-giving waters of the city's river have turned black and putrid, tainting the land and sickening those who drink from it. Rumors suggest that an ancient curse from **The Woods** has befallen the river.                                                        |
| **2**  | A haunting chorus of anguished cries echoes through the forest. Some say an otherworldly presence from **The Roots** has seeped into the earth, infecting the woods with its sorrow. Each day the voices of tree and bird alike grows more quiet.                        |
| **3**  | A thick, unnatural fog has descended upon an ancient and holy grove, and is slowly expanding. It is said to be the work of a great spirit, disturbed by the expansion of **The Cobbles**.                                                                                |
| **4**  | The night sky grows dimmer each evening, as if stars are disappearing one by one. Some believe it's a sign of an impending disaster, while others suspect the influence of a powerful Fae from **The Woods**.                                                            |
| **5**  | The songbirds of **The Woods** have fallen eerily silent. Hunters claim that a spectral figure has been spotted wandering the forest, cursing the land with its presence.                                                                                                |
| **6**  | Strange, tear-shaped stones have been found throughout the region. The locals believe they are the tears of the earth itself, weeping for a great tragedy yet to come.                                                                                                   |
| **7**  | A **crops spirit** has granted you a vision of great danger. You pledged to prevent it. Take a **wheat charm**.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **8**  | In your village there lies a mother tree. They say it has always been there, holding the town's secrets in its boughs and roots. Recently it began bleeding red sap, and the elders are worried. Take a **leaf** from the tree. It turns a deep red when danger is near. |
| **9**  | The moon turns a deep crimson, bathing the night in an eerie, blood-red light. Some say it heralds a time of chaos and strife, as the boundaries between **The Woods** and the mortal realm grow thin.                                                                   |
| **10** | You found a wounded beast in the forest, but chose to ignore it. You see it everywhere now, but only when you're alone. It looks sad, but not angry.                                                                                                                     |
| **11** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
