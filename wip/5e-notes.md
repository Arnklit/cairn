### 5e Notes

- For **STR**, choose the highest between STR or CON, consider increasing if it has a lot of HP.
- Use **DEX** as it is.
- For **WIL** choose the highest between WIS or CHA.

#### AC to Armor
- 12 AC or less = no armor
- 13+ AC = 1 Armor
- 16+ AC = 2 Armor
- 20+ AC = 3 Armor

- For HP Use **CR** as a starting point; consider it the "levels of threat".
- 1-6 HP  are most humanoids and creatures of similar power.
- 7-12 HP are serious foes, people that are exceptionally trained or creatures of uncommon power. Large animals, most monstrosities and extra planar creatures fall here.
- 13-18 HP are large threats. Dragons, Giants, that sort of enemy that can cause massive destruction.
- Attacks/damage are mostly as is, in the case of weapons, use the damage the weapon deals in Cairn rules. If a attack has a lot of damage dice, give it advantage (EG d8+d8) in Cairn. Use damage advantage in place of multiattacks too.
