## One Shot idea
#### Ideas from Brad
- A smaller locale built around a singular purpose (something like "find the thing," "save this guy," or "escape")
- "Normal" enough that it could be a one-shot or inserted into a fantasy campaign.
- Plays into the strengths of Cairn (play it to have fun, not to get XP, kill monsters, or make gold).
- I think folkloric western European vibes are about right for Cairn.
- Maybe like a forest crawl. "A kid disappeared into the weird forest that nobody is supposed to ever go into!"
- Weird creatures with conflicting goals, freaky monsters, a puzzle or two.
