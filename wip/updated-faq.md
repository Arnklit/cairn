A standard combat scenario would work like this:

#### Round 1
- PCs make a DEX save. Those who successfully pass go before the enemies (consider them collectively one "side"). They go in whatever order they wish, though the results are simultaneous.
- All enemies go, in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results are simultaneous.

#### Round 2
- _All_ PCs (including those that failed the original DEX save) get to go in whatever order they wish. The results are simultaneous.
- _All_ enemies get to go in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results are simultaneous.

#### Round 3
- All PCs get to go.
- All enemies get to go.
