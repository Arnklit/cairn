## Updated FAQ

### How do detachments work?

### How do you increase or decrease the difficulty and outcome of a save without advantage or disadvantage?

### How does autohit work?

### Do monsters use the same combat rules as PCs (e.g. critical save)

### How does having 10 inventory actually work?

### What are examples of deprived conditions?

### How does the Armor cap work? What's the difference between Armor of equal values

### How does initiative in combat work?
A standard combat scenario would work like this:

#### Round 1
_This only occurs in this way if there are PCs that failed the initial DEX save._
- PCs make a DEX save. Those who pass go before the enemies (consider them collectively one "side"). They go in whatever order they wish, though the results are simultaneous.
- All enemies go, in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results are simultaneous.

#### Round 2
- _All_ PCs (including those that failed the original DEX save) get to go in whatever order they wish. The results are simultaneous.
- _All_ enemies get to go in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results are simultaneous.

#### Round 3
- All PCs get to go.
- All enemies get to go.

And so on.  
**Note**: _The only other caveat here would be if someone left combat (usually via a DEX save) and then re-entered combat; you'd need to make a ruling dependent on the situation._
