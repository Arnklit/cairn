# Good Dungeon Design

## Principles of Good Dungeon Design (Questing Beast)
### 1. Multiple Entrances/Exits
- Avoids the players feeling railroaded
- Add information to doorways and such (lets them choose the kind of fun they want to have)

### 2. Consider why it was built in the first place
- How long ago?
- What was it used for? Is it different now?
- What was it designed to keep out?

### 3. Levels
- Represents gradation of danger
- Adds a gambling aspect (how far do I want to go?)

### 4. Have loops
- Avoid linear design
- Avoid tree-like structure (dead end paths)
- Create a network of linked rooms and corridors in different ways
- Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

### 5. Have a lot of verticality
- Have tall rooms (galleries), things to climb on
- Mineshafts going down
- Things that give the players something to drop on to
- Makes mapping more difficult but also more fun
- Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through

### 6. Create secret areas/zones
- Have at least one place the players might not find
- Have clues that say, "there is something weird with this room"
- Allowing players to feel the accomplishment of discovery. Very rewarding.

### 7. Variety in Room types
- Height, shape (octagonal)
- Make sure they are easy to describe, adds texture and variety
- Helps the players see how the rooms were used
- Helps players recognize rooms
- Use architectural motifs to help connect rooms thematically, helps players as they move from one room to another

### 8. Tactically useful areas
- Having noticeable areas that players can see ways to use it for their advantage
- Chokepoints (bridges, narrow corridors), places you have to crawl
- Uphill (rolling boulders down)

### 9. Spying opportunities
- Information is important for meaningful choices
- Portcullis where enemies can be heard but can't see PCs
- One-way mirrors, speaking tubes, etc

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._
