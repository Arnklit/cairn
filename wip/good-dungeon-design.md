# Good Dungeon Design

## Principles of Good Dungeon Design (Questing Beast)
### 1. Multiple Entrances/Exits
- Avoids the players feeling railroaded
- Add information to doorways and such (lets them choose the kind of fun they want to have)

### 2. Consider why it was built in the first place
- How long ago?
- What was it used for? Is it different now?
- What was it designed to keep out?

### 3. Levels
- Represents gradation of danger
- Adds a gambling aspect (how far do I want to go?)

### 4. Have loops
- Avoid linear design
- Avoid tree-like structure (dead end paths)
- Create a network of linked rooms and corridors in different ways
- Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

### 5. Have a lot of verticality
- Have tall rooms (galleries), things to climb on
- Mineshafts going down
- Things that give the players something to drop on to
- Makes mapping more difficult but also more fun
- Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through

### 6. Create secret areas/zones
- Have at least one place the players might not find
- Have clues that say, "there is something weird with this room"
- Allowing players to feel the accomplishment of discovery. Very rewarding.

### 7. Variety in Room types
- Height, shape (octagonal)
- Make sure they are easy to describe, adds texture and variety
- Helps the players see how the rooms were used
- Helps players recognize rooms
- Use architectural motifs to help connect rooms thematically, helps players as they move from one room to another

### 8. Tactically useful areas
- Having noticeable areas that players can see ways to use it for their advantage
- Chokepoints (bridges, narrow corridors), places you have to crawl
- Uphill (rolling boulders down)

### 9. Spying opportunities
- Information is important for meaningful choices
- Portcullis where enemies can be heard but can't see PCs
- One-way mirrors, speaking tubes, etc

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

## Dungeon Checklist (Goblin Punch)
### Something to steal


### Something to be killed

### Something to kill you

### Different Paths

### Someone to talk to

## Grognardia OSR Dungeon Design Guidelines
1. Environmental hazards -- slippery floors, rooms that flood, narrow ledges over steep drops, rooms that are excessively hot or cold, rooms or corridors filled with poison (or otherwise magical) gasses, etc.

2. Combat encounters should generally be with baseline (or near-baseline) monsters with difficulty enhanced by the circumstances of the encounter (i.e. monsters have set up ambushes, monsters forcing the PCs to fight in unfavorable surroundings, teams of similar (or dissimilar) monster-types working together, etc.) rather than through templates or class-leveling

3. At least one encounter that if played as a straight combat will totally overmatch the party, but which can be avoided or circumvented by some clever means

4. At least one puzzle, trick, or obstacle that requires the players to figure it out, rather than being solvable by a die-roll

5. At least one item, location, or creature that causes some kind of significant permanent effect (permanently raise/lower stats or hp, permanently change race, gender, or alignment, permanently grant or take away magic items, etc.) determined by a random roll on a table -- with possibilities for both good and bad effects, depending on the roll

6. At least one item of treasure that is cursed or has other detrimental side-effects on the owner/possessor

7. Some sort of "false climax" where inattentive players will think they've won the adventure and either let their guard down or go home, while clever players will realize this couldn't have really been the climax

8. At least one disorienting effect. teleporter, mirror trap, [swiveling] floor, or maze like monster. up is down too.

9. An area where resources are an issue. wet torches or wind blowing them out. oxygen low or having to hold your breath to swim [through] a tunnel.

10. An area that has items of value. but they are too large to transport. or cause someone to have his hands full at an ambush.

11. A creature that appears to be something it is not. Some examples: Lurker above, mimic, [cloaker], wolf in sheep's clothing, doppelganger, gas spore (perhaps my favorite), etc.

12. One encounter (no more, no less) that makes absolutely no logical sense, that the DM completely leaves up to the players' imagination to explain.

## Other stuff
- Add generic details to the key, like "unless otherwise noted, the dungeon is musty, wet, etc..."


## Chris McDowall's Three Step Dungeons
### The Three Step Process

- Introduce First Concept
- Introduce Second Concept
- Challenge involving both concepts and an additional twist, typically with a reward.

### Concepts
First think of a bunch of interesting concepts you want to include in your dungeon. They can be monsters, items, hazards, or anything between.
- You don’t really need to include things that are dead simple like “skeleton warriors” or “pit traps” but if you plan on putting a twist on them then add them in too. You can also skip out anything that has no real element of danger, say a crystal ball that lets you see other areas of the dungeon.
- And we’ll be introducing them two at a time. This could be a small dungeon that only introduces two new concepts, or a sprawling dungeon comprised of smaller sections that each focus on two concepts.

### The Introductions
Ideally this is an opportunity for the players to get information about the concept in a mostly safe way before it really challenges them. It needn't even be a direct encounter, the common example being a statuary that introduces the presence of a Medusa.
- The Intro and the Challenge could even feature the same individual monster encountered in two separate environments, if the Intro leans towards a non-hostile introduction.
- I lean pretty heavily into giving lots of information, so you may find that less works for your group.

### The Challenge
Sometimes just combining the two concepts is enough, but usually it’s better to add something else in.  Some ideas could be:
- A beefed up version of the regular concept.
- Adding an “opposite” element to the monster, such as a hyper-intelligent variant of a previously dumb monster, or a pacifist version of a hostile monster.
- Adding a load of basic monsters.
- An environment that makes things more difficult for the players.
- A restriction on how the players can act.
- Removing a safety net that was previously in place.
- Remember to put a reward in there, Treasure being the most obvious but even just passage to a new area would work.

### Adding Extra Stuff
If you go straight from concept one to concept two to a combination of both it can end up feeling quite game-y, like you're playing a Megaman level that's built around new enemies rather than a real place you're exploring. This isn’t a bad thing if that’s what you want, but if you want things to feel more organic then consider that a Three Step Dungeon need not be a Three Room Dungeon:
- You can have simpler areas in between that don’t require introductions or just give some clues for the larger dungeon. 
- You can include basic elements that don’t require explanation or previously introduced concepts.
- You can have nonlinear layout but keep the Introductions on the “main path” as best you can.
