# Good Dungeon Design

## Principles of Good Dungeon Design (Questing Beast)
### 1. Multiple Entrances/Exits
- Avoids the players feeling railroaded
- Add information to doorways and such (lets them choose the kind of fun they want to have)

### 2. Consider why it was built in the first place
- How long ago?
- What was it used for? Is it different now?
- What was it designed to keep out?

### 3. Levels
- Represents gradation of danger
- Adds a gambling aspect (how far do I want to go?)

### 4. Have loops
- Avoid linear design
- Avoid tree-like structure (dead end paths)
- Create a network of linked rooms and corridors in different ways
- Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

### 5. Have a lot of verticality
- Have tall rooms (galleries), things to climb on
- Mineshafts going down
- Things that give the players something to drop on to
- Makes mapping more difficult but also more fun
- Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through

### 6. Create secret areas/zones
- Have at least one place the players might not find
- Have clues that say, "there is something weird with this room"
- Allowing players to feel the accomplishment of discovery. Very rewarding.

### 7. Variety in Room types
- Height, shape (octagonal)
- Make sure they are easy to describe, adds texture and variety
- Helps the players see how the rooms were used
- Helps players recognize rooms
- Use architectural motifs to help connect rooms thematically, helps players as they move from one room to another

### 8. Tactically useful areas
- Having noticeable areas that players can see ways to use it for their advantage
- Chokepoints (bridges, narrow corridors), places you have to crawl
- Uphill (rolling boulders down)

### 9. Spying opportunities
- Information is important for meaningful choices
- Portcullis where enemies can be heard but can't see PCs
- One-way mirrors, speaking tubes, etc

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

## Dungeon Checklist (Goblin Punch)
### Something to steal


### Something to be killed

### Something to kill you

### Different Paths

### Someone to talk to

## Grognardia OSR Dungeon Design Guidelines
1. Environmental hazards -- slippery floors, rooms that flood, narrow ledges over steep drops, rooms that are excessively hot or cold, rooms or corridors filled with poison (or otherwise magical) gasses, etc.

2. Combat encounters should generally be with baseline (or near-baseline) monsters with difficulty enhanced by the circumstances of the encounter (i.e. monsters have set up ambushes, monsters forcing the PCs to fight in unfavorable surroundings, teams of similar (or dissimilar) monster-types working together, etc.) rather than through templates or class-leveling

3. At least one encounter that if played as a straight combat will totally overmatch the party, but which can be avoided or circumvented by some clever means

4. At least one puzzle, trick, or obstacle that requires the players to figure it out, rather than being solvable by a die-roll

5. At least one item, location, or creature that causes some kind of significant permanent effect (permanently raise/lower stats or hp, permanently change race, gender, or alignment, permanently grant or take away magic items, etc.) determined by a random roll on a table -- with possibilities for both good and bad effects, depending on the roll

6. At least one item of treasure that is cursed or has other detrimental side-effects on the owner/possessor

7. Some sort of "false climax" where inattentive players will think they've won the adventure and either let their guard down or go home, while clever players will realize this couldn't have really been the climax

8. At least one disorienting effect. teleporter, mirror trap, [swiveling] floor, or maze like monster. up is down too.

9. An area where resources are an issue. wet torches or wind blowing them out. oxygen low or having to hold your breath to swim [through] a tunnel.

10. An area that has items of value. but they are too large to transport. or cause someone to have his hands full at an ambush.

11. A creature that appears to be something it is not. Some examples: Lurker above, mimic, [cloaker], wolf in sheep's clothing, doppelganger, gas spore (perhaps my favorite), etc.

12. One encounter (no more, no less) that makes absolutely no logical sense, that the DM completely leaves up to the players' imagination to explain.

## Other stuff
- Add generic details to the key, like "unless otherwise noted, the dungeon is musty, wet, etc..."
