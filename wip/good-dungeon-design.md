# Good Dungeon Design

## Principles of Good Dungeon Design (Questing Beast)
### 1. Multiple Entrances/Exits
- Avoids the players feeling railroaded
- Add information to doorways and such (lets them choose the kind of fun they want to have)

### 2. Consider why it was built in the first place
- How long ago?
- What was it used for? Is it different now?
- What was it designed to keep out?

### 3. Levels
- Represents gradation of danger
- Adds a gambling aspect (how far do I want to go?)

### 4. Have loops
- Avoid linear design
- Avoid tree-like structure (dead end paths)
- Create a network of linked rooms and corridors in different ways
- Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

### 5. Have a lot of verticality
- Have tall rooms (galleries), things to climb on
- Mineshafts going down
- Things that give the players something to drop on to
- Makes mapping more difficult but also more fun
- Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through

### 6. Create secret areas/zones
- Have at least one place the players might not find
- Have clues that say, "there is something weird with this room"
- Allowing players to feel the accomplishment of discovery. Very rewarding.

### 7. Variety in Room types
- Height, shape (octagonal)
- Make sure they are easy to describe, adds texture and variety
- Helps the players see how the rooms were used
- Helps players recognize rooms
- Use architectural motifs to help connect rooms thematically, helps players as they move from one room to another

### 8. Tactically useful areas
- Having noticeable areas that players can see ways to use it for their advantage
- Chokepoints (bridges, narrow corridors), places you have to crawl
- Uphill (rolling boulders down)

### 9. Spying opportunities
- Information is important for meaningful choices
- Portcullis where enemies can be heard but can't see PCs
- One-way mirrors, speaking tubes, etc

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

## Dungeon Checklist (Goblin Punch)
### 1. Something to steal
Treasure gives players a reason to go into the dungeon in the first place.  On a metagame level, treasure is money, money is XP, and XP is tied to the idea of character advancement.  It's the prime mover of the system.
First, remember that treasure doesn't need to be treasure. It can be:
- Shiny shit, such as boring ol' coins, or the jewelled brassiere of the zombie queen.
- Knowledge, such as where to find more treasure, or information you can use to blackmail the king.  Or even a sage, who can answer a single question honestly.
- Friendship, such as an amorous purple worm that follows you around and protects you when it's hungry and a little bored.  Occasionally, it leaves egg sacs laying around for you to fertilize (and it will get angry if you don't sit on them for at least an hour).
- Trade Goods, like a wagon full of tea (worth 10,000gp).  When I give out large parcels of trade goods as treasure, I give half of the XP now, and the other half of the XP when it's sold off.  (I just really like the idea of a mercantile campaign.)
- Territorial, like a tower the players can claim as their own, or an apartment in the nice party of the city (and the chances of being stabbed in your sleep are dramatically reduced).
- Useful adventuring shit, like a magic sword, scroll of blot out the sun, or a parachute.

Second, treasure tells a story, too.  Cover your treasure in religious symbols, anoint it in trollblood.  Don't let your coins be coins!

### 2. Something to be killed
This is pretty obvious.  Of course there are threatening things in the dungeon.  There has to be some challenge otherwise it isn't a dungeon.  The simplest way to do that is with things that are trying to kill you.  

Also remember that dungeons tell their story through nouns.  The history of a dungeon is usually relayed through monster choices (why use orcs when you can use degenerate cannibal versions of the original dwarven inhabitants?) and descriptions of those creatures (a barnacle-covered zombie, an iron golem charred by dragonfire, the elven armor scraps that the goblins are wearing, the elven wand-rifle that one of the goblins has for some reason).

### 3. Something to kill you
Dungeons are designed to be beaten.  That's why we don't fill them with inescapable obstacles (rocks fall, everyone dies) or impenetrable barriers (sorry, the whole dungeon is wrapped in an adamantine dome, you can't get in).
- Dungeons need to feel like they were designed to be unbeatable.
- Label your deadly shit as such.  A sleeping dragon.  A door barricaded from the player's side with a sign warning of deadly spiders.  These things look deadly from a distance.
- A chance to escape.  Maybe the dragon can't fit into the smaller tunnels around his lair.  Maybe the manticore is chained to a rock.
- Both of these serve the same function: they allow the players to pick their own battles, something you can't do on a linear railroad game.  I think that's why a lot of OSR folks hate the idea of boss battles: because they're the one battle in the dungeon that is required.
- Horrible monsters that are avoidable give the players agency and allows them to be architects of their own demise.
- I think that nearly all combats should be escapable. Sometimes with a cost (dropped food, gold, maybe a dead PC or hireling). In my experience PCs will get themselves killed often enough even if the enemies never left the rooms they were in.
- Also, putting "unbeatable" monsters in your dungeon also allows the dungeon to be self-scaling.  The level 1 party will just tip-toe past the dragon, while the level 6 party might consider fighting it so they steal the treasure it is sleeping on top of.  And just like that, a dungeon becomes appropriate for both level 1 parties AND level 6 parties.  (And this is another reason why I think OSR games have such a wide range of level-appropriateness; It's both easy and expected that players will flee from fights that they can't win).

### 4. Different Paths
- Different paths allow different parties to experience the dungeon in different ways.  It's a randomizer, similar to what you'd get if you ordered the dungeon rooms according to a random number generator.
- Player agency.  Players can choose the path they're better suited for.  The party with 2 clerics can take the zombie-infested tunnel, and the party with air support can get themselves dropped into the courtyard.  It also allows dungeons to be a little bit self-adjusting, too.  Players who are more confident can challenge the front door, while lower level parties will creep around the outside.
- It allows parties to walk away from rooms they don't like.  Part of the OSR philosophy (as I see it) is the ability to walk away from fights.  If a party doesn't want to fight a room with archer skeletons entombed in the walls (especially after two of them were blinded in the last room) they can retreat and find another way in.  It's an option they have.
- The last reason to have multiple paths is to allow for dungeon mastery.  I don't mean DMing.  I mean that, as the players learn more about the dungeon, they become better at exploiting its geography.  They can lure the carrion crawler over the pit trap that they know is there.  They can retreat into a looped path, instead of retreating into unexplored rooms (always a dangerous tactic).
- At the same time, don't throw in random paths just for the hell of it.  The more paths you put in, the less linearity there is in your dungeon.  And sometimes you want linearity, especially when it comes to teaching your players things, or giving clues.
- There's nothing wrong with a little linearity if you're putting it in there for a reason.  I still think that a heavily branched dungeon should be the default assumption, but linear sections of a dungeon are a venal sin, not a mortal one.

### 5. Someone to talk to
EVERY DUNGEON NEEDS SOMEONE TO TALK TO.  It's a roleplaying game.  NPCs are the cheapest and easiest way to add depth to your dungeon.  It's easy because everyone knows how to roleplay a generic goblin prisoner and has a pretty good idea of what information/services that goblin prisoner can provide.  And it's got depth because there are so many ways that a party can use a goblin prisoner.  There's almost no bloat--you don't need to invent new mechanics, and it takes almost no space to write "There is a goblin in a cage.  His name is Zerglum and he has been imprisoned by his fellows for setting rats free."

The problem is that a lot of dungeons are treasure vaults, tombs, and abandoned mines.  The only creatures you usually encounter in those places are undead, golems, oozes, and vermin with ambiguous food chains.  None of those are really known for being chatty.  So, here are some options:
- Rival adventuring party.
- Goblins never need explanation.
- Spell effect, like a chatty magic mouth spell or something.
- Graveyard nymph.
-  Make a sympathetic one.  Everyone expects them to be jerks.
- Ghoul head, sitting on a shelf.  It can talk if you blow through its neck-hole.
- Old man trapped in a painting.  Communicates by painting.
- Demon trapped in a mirror.  Communicates by repeating your own phrases back to you.
- Ancient war machine trapped by a stasis field bomb.  Seeks enemies who died thousands of years ago, will self-destruct when it learns that it lost the war.
- Consider giving your players speak with stones or speak with lock spells.  Dungeons usually have those.
- Demonic succubus, who has spent the last 1000 years on a bed, trapped by the silver threads woven into a circle in the bedsheet
- Pterodactyl-riding barbarians who are looting the place
- Time-displaced wizard, caught in a paradox while exploring the place.  Resets every 3 minutes.

### 6. Something to experiment with
Aside from something that will probably kick the party's ass, I think this might be the most OSR-ish. These are the unexplainable, the weird, and the unknown.  And I don't mean unknown like an unidentified potion is unknown.  I mean something that introduces a new wrinkle into the game.
- A room with two doors of different sizes.  Anything that is put into the small door emerges from the large door at twice the size, and vice versa.  Anything that goes through the doors twice in the same direction (double enlarged or double shrunk) has terrible consequences.
- A pedestal.  If anything is placed on top of it, it turns into its opposite.  (Okay, the opposite of a sword is an axe, but what is the opposite of a banana?)
- A metal skeleton.  If a skull is placed atop it, a speak with dead spell is cast on it.
- Wishing wells that are portals to other small ponds in the dungeon.  Where the portal goes is determined by what item you throw in the well before you jump in.  Copper coins, silver coins, gold coins, gems, and arrows all lead to different places.
- Two doorways.  Impassable when you walk through a single one, but if two people walk through them simultaneously, they are fused together and transported to a city of similarly-fused people.
- A machine that turns finished products into raw goods, and raw goods into ammunition.
- A sundial that controls the sun.
- A boat golem that flees from loud noises.  You can direct it by standing at the back of it and shouting.
- Two holes in the wall.  If two limbs are put in the holes, they are swapped.  If only one limb is put in the hole, it is severed.  Can be used to graft new limbs onto amputees.

### 7. Something the players probably won't find
Why put stuff in your dungeon that your players won't find?
- First, you don't have to put much in the dungeon.  Just a few words here and there to reward the players who are more thorough.  "Inside the purple worm's stomach is a bag of holding full of 1000 gallons of purple worm stomach acid."  Or "The pirate captain has a gold bar hidden in his peg leg, wrapped in felt so that it won't rattle."  It's not like you're designing multiple cool rooms that no one will ever get to enjoy.  (I mean, I do that sometimes.)
- I think it's important to hide things because there is a sincere joy in exploration and testing the limits.  If all of the things in a dungeon are obvious, why even bother wondering what is at the bottom of the well?  Is there anything interesting buried underneath all of this mud?  Players who don't have the time or resources to explore a dungeon 100% (and they shouldn't) will always walk away with a feeling of enormity, that there was always more to find. Sure, completion is a nice feeling, but so is wonderment.
- I like to reward people who are good at the game.  And being good at finding things (thinking about where they might be, exploring those places despite the risk it involves) is one of the ways that a player can be good at D&D.  I've written about this before.
- It should be a spectrum.  Some things (most things) should be out in the open. Some stuff should be hidden behind curtains.  And some stuff should be tucked deeply away in the dungeon's folds.

## Grognardia OSR Dungeon Design Guidelines
1. Environmental hazards -- slippery floors, rooms that flood, narrow ledges over steep drops, rooms that are excessively hot or cold, rooms or corridors filled with poison (or otherwise magical) gasses, etc.
2. Combat encounters should generally be with baseline (or near-baseline) monsters with difficulty enhanced by the circumstances of the encounter (i.e. monsters have set up ambushes, monsters forcing the PCs to fight in unfavorable surroundings, teams of similar (or dissimilar) monster-types working together, etc.) rather than through templates or class-leveling
3. At least one encounter that if played as a straight combat will totally overmatch the party, but which can be avoided or circumvented by some clever means
4. At least one puzzle, trick, or obstacle that requires the players to figure it out, rather than being solvable by a die-roll
5. At least one item, location, or creature that causes some kind of significant permanent effect (permanently raise/lower stats or hp, permanently change race, gender, or alignment, permanently grant or take away magic items, etc.) determined by a random roll on a table -- with possibilities for both good and bad effects, depending on the roll
6. At least one item of treasure that is cursed or has other detrimental side-effects on the owner/possessor
7. Some sort of "false climax" where inattentive players will think they've won the adventure and either let their guard down or go home, while clever players will realize this couldn't have really been the climax
8. At least one disorienting effect. teleporter, mirror trap, [swiveling] floor, or maze like monster. up is down too.
9. An area where resources are an issue. wet torches or wind blowing them out. oxygen low or having to hold your breath to swim [through] a tunnel.
10. An area that has items of value. but they are too large to transport. or cause someone to have his hands full at an ambush.
11. A creature that appears to be something it is not. Some examples: Lurker above, mimic, [cloaker], wolf in sheep's clothing, doppelganger, gas spore (perhaps my favorite), etc.
12. One encounter (no more, no less) that makes absolutely no logical sense, that the DM completely leaves up to the players' imagination to explain.

## Chris McDowall's Three Step Dungeons
### The Three Step Process
- Introduce First Concept
- Introduce Second Concept
- Challenge involving both concepts and an additional twist, typically with a reward.

### Concepts
First think of a bunch of interesting concepts you want to include in your dungeon. They can be monsters, items, hazards, or anything between.
- You don’t really need to include things that are dead simple like “skeleton warriors” or “pit traps” but if you plan on putting a twist on them then add them in too. You can also skip out anything that has no real element of danger, say a crystal ball that lets you see other areas of the dungeon.
- And we’ll be introducing them two at a time. This could be a small dungeon that only introduces two new concepts, or a sprawling dungeon comprised of smaller sections that each focus on two concepts.

### The Introductions
Ideally this is an opportunity for the players to get information about the concept in a mostly safe way before it really challenges them. It needn't even be a direct encounter, the common example being a statuary that introduces the presence of a Medusa.
- The Intro and the Challenge could even feature the same individual monster encountered in two separate environments, if the Intro leans towards a non-hostile introduction.
- I lean pretty heavily into giving lots of information, so you may find that less works for your group.

### The Challenge
Sometimes just combining the two concepts is enough, but usually it’s better to add something else in.  Some ideas could be:
- A beefed up version of the regular concept.
- Adding an “opposite” element to the monster, such as a hyper-intelligent variant of a previously dumb monster, or a pacifist version of a hostile monster.
- Adding a load of basic monsters.
- An environment that makes things more difficult for the players.
- A restriction on how the players can act.
- Removing a safety net that was previously in place.
- Remember to put a reward in there, Treasure being the most obvious but even just passage to a new area would work.

### Adding Extra Stuff
If you go straight from concept one to concept two to a combination of both it can end up feeling quite game-y, like you're playing a Megaman level that's built around new enemies rather than a real place you're exploring. This isn’t a bad thing if that’s what you want, but if you want things to feel more organic then consider that a Three Step Dungeon need not be a Three Room Dungeon:
- You can have simpler areas in between that don’t require introductions or just give some clues for the larger dungeon.
- You can include basic elements that don’t require explanation or previously introduced concepts.
- You can have nonlinear layout but keep the Introductions on the “main path” as best you can.

## [/u/grodog's comments](https://www.reddit.com/user/grodog)

### My favorite elements in dungeon adventures:
- fun environments to explore and map
- challenging encounters
- evocative and engaging puzzles, enigmas, and centerpiece encounters
- good, functional layout and design

### I also like lots of different types of adventure settings/sites:
- City and town adventures
- Dungeons: small @ 1-3 levels, medium@ 4-7 levels, mega-dungeons @ 8+ levels
- Lairs: small groups of 5-10 rooms in a single level
- Mysteries - murder or otherwise
- Planar - exploring the multiverses, Elric-style
- Quests - probably epic, or at least important
- Wilderness: aquatic, islands, pirates, undersea, etc.; overland: "there and back again"; underworld: journey to the center of the earth

### And I like games/adventures that support different types of interaction:
- Advancing your character in level/power
- Conquering and/or destroying the world
- Developing your character's history and personality through campaign play
- Exploration into the unknown
- Killing monsters and taking their stuff
- Learning the setting/campaign mysteries
- Mapping the dungeon, wilderness, city, etc.
- Role-playing your character with other PCs and/or with NPCs
- Saving the world and/or making the world a better place

## Random Notes:
- Add generic details to the key, like "unless otherwise noted, the dungeon is musty, wet, etc..."
