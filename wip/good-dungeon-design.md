### Different Paths

### Someone to talk to

## Principles of Dungeon Design (Questing Beast)
### 1. Multiple Entrances/Exits
- Avoids the players feeling railroaded
- Add information to doorways and such (lets them choose the kind of fun they want to have)

### 2. Consider why it was built in the first place
- How long ago?
- What was it used for? Is it different now?
- What was it designed to keep out?

### 3. Levels
- Represents gradation of danger
- Adds a gambling aspect (how far do I want to go?)

### 4. Have loops
- Avoid linear design
- Avoid tree-like structure (dead end paths)
- Create a network of linked rooms and cooridors in different ways
- Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

### 5. Have a lot of verticality
- Have tall rooms (galleries), things to climb on
- Mineshafts going down
- Things that give the players something to drop on to
- Makes mapping more difficult but also more fun
- Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through

### 6. Create secret areas/zones
- Have at least one place the players might not find
- Have clues that say, "there is something weird with this room"
- Allowing players to feel the accomplishment of discovery. Very rewarding.

### 7. Variety in Room types
