## How to Create names

When it comes to combining adjectives and nouns to create evocative location names, there are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Specificity: The more specific your adjective and noun choices, the more evocative and memorable the name will be. For example, "Golden Barley" is more specific than "Golden Fields," which is more specific than "Golden Landscape."
2. Contrast: Using contrasting adjectives and nouns can create interesting and memorable combinations. For example, "Thorny Meadows" combines two seemingly opposite concepts, making it a memorable name.
3. Alliteration: Using words with the same initial sound can make a name more catchy and memorable. For example, "Babbling Brook" and "Misty Glen" both use alliteration to make their names more memorable.
4. Sound: Words that sound pleasing when combined can make for memorable names. For example, "Swaying Savanna" has a pleasant sound to it.

When you roll on a table like the one provided, you can use these guidelines to choose which combination of adjective and noun is the most descriptive and evocative. You can also try combining the results of multiple rolls, as I did in some of the examples, to create even more interesting and memorable names.
