## Introduction
### The Provinces
- Large, settled regions under the control of a ruler. Regardless of the ruler, all lands are considered a part of **The Provinces**.
- The borders of **The Provinces** ebb and flow as rulers marry, conquer, and destroy each other.

### The Fields
- Any farms, orchards, or meadows within **The Provinces** that owe a tax or tithe in exchange for cultivation rights and basic protections.
- Cities are typically connected to farms and villages via roads and footpaths. 

### The Wood
- Any forested terrain within **The Provinces**. All forests are considered part of **The Wood**, no matter how isolated. 
- Its denizens believe that they are subject solely to the rules of **The Wood**, and none other. And so, they are forever at war with **The Provinces**.

### The Marches
- Any lands beyond the boundary of **The Provinces** that lack a single monarch or ruler. 
- Typically wilder and less "civilized."

### The Roots
- Remnants of the **Old World**. Its labyrinthine hollows stretch across **The Provinces**, connecting both city sewers to far-flung ruins. 
- Only the brave or foolish have dared enter **The Roots**, in search of forgotten **Relics** or powerful **Spellbooks**. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures.
