## How did you become a Border Guardian?

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | You were born into a family with a long tradition of serving as border guardians. From a young age, you were taught the art of combat, scouting, and survival. |
| **2** | You once lived a life of crime but found redemption by protecting the border. You've dedicated your life to ensuring the safety of those who live in the Marches. |
| **3** | You were a merchant who frequently traveled across the border. After witnessing the dangers faced by the people of the Marches, you decided to take up arms and protect them. |
| **4** | You were conscripted into the border guard as a youth and, despite the challenges and dangers, you found your purpose in protecting your homeland. |
| **5** | You were a wanderer who stumbled upon the Marches, where you found a sense of belonging. You decided to stay and become a border guardian, using your skills to protect the land and its people. |
| **6** | You were a member of a scouting party that was ambushed near the border. You were the sole survivor and swore an oath to protect the Marches from future threats. |

## Why did you leave the Watch? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | You were falsely accused of a crime and forced to leave, but you managed to take a valuable map of secret border crossings with you. |
| **2** | You fell in love with someone who lived outside the border, and you decided to follow your heart. You learned a unique herbal remedy from your lover. |
| **3** | You sustained a serious injury that forced you to retire, but during your recovery, you befriended a skilled blacksmith who taught you how to maintain and repair weapons. |
| **4** | You discovered corruption within the border guard, and after exposing the culprits, you decided to strike out on your own. You gained a contact within the Marches' criminal underworld. |
| **5** | A spiritual experience led you to question your path, and you left the Watch to seek greater wisdom. You acquired a rare tome of ancient knowledge. |
| **6** | You were offered a more lucrative position elsewhere, but you couldn't forget your roots. You left with a powerful enchanted compass that always points to the nearest border. |

## What did you see that drove you from The Watch? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                              |

| **1** | You witnessed a terrifying creature from the depths of The Roots emerge and attack a nearby village. In the aftermath, you found an odd, glowing crystal with mysterious properties. |
| **2** | You stumbled upon a hidden grove where fey creatures danced and played, but their magic left you feeling lost and disconnected from your duties. They gifted you a charm that brings good fortune. |
| **3** | You saw a powerful sorcerer summon a demon to do their bidding, leading you to question the nature of good and evil. As you fled, you managed to grab a tome of forbidden arcane knowledge. |
| **4** | While patrolling the border, you came across a field of strange, luminescent flowers. These flowers revealed hidden truths and caused you to doubt the Watch's purpose. You took a handful of seeds to plant elsewhere. |
| **5** | You discovered an ancient ruin buried beneath the land, filled with the ghosts of a long-lost civilization. One of the spirits gave you an enchanted amulet that can calm restless souls. |
| **6** | You encountered a group of outlaws who revealed the suffering caused by the Watch's actions. Unable to reconcile your beliefs with their stories, you left the Watch and took a beautifully crafted dagger gifted to you by the outlaws. |
