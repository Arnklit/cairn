# Debts, Bonds, Omens

## Introduction

The goal is to encourage party cooperation, further questing, and character growth.
There are a few ways of doing some of these, but it is tricky to do all of them.
I like the idea of individual characters having a particular debt as well.

Players roll up 3 characters (Two from The Cobbles, one from The Wood).
--> Depending on some metric I have yet to determine, they roll on the [Debt] table for The Cobbles.
--> Cobbles Debts are more economic: you owe money to so and so, you're an outlaw in X place, you angered some noble.

The result is a shared [Debt] for each PC, encouraging them to:
- Work together
- Make money (e.g. questing)
- Go on an adventure (baked-in quest hook)
- Get back their [stuff, reputation, whatever]
I was thinking that some Domains might have more of one thing than others. The Cobbles and The Fields would have more Debts (or at least, more monetary Debts) while The Woods & The Marches might have Omens (things they need to stop) or Bonds (honor-bound Oaths).


### Debts

Example **Debt** from **The Woods**:  
**The Wooded Dead**, a group of benign Forest Liches. After trespassing on a sacred grove, they demand you plant a grove of rare (and expensive) **Corpsewood** trees, whose saplings grow wherever the dead rest in great numbers. Until your debt is paid, travelling through **The Woods** is slower, and forest critters shy away from you.  

Example **Debt** from **The Marches**:  
**The Dawn Brigade**: They helped get you out, asking for only one thing in return: Cross the border. Deep in **The Marches** there is a glade of primrose and ash. In its center is a **Blood Flower**. You have three months to bring it to them before **The Bloodhounds** find you.

Example **Debt** from **The Fields**:  
**Famine Relief**: A local village provided you with food and shelter during a time of great need. They expect you to return the favor by finding a solution to the blight that has stricken their crops. 

Example **Debt** from **The Cobbles**:  
**The Ironscale Syndicate**: You borrowed money from a notorious criminal organization to cover a desperate need. They expect you to repay the loan with considerable interest. Until the debt is paid, their enforcers will hound you, making it difficult to rest or find sanctuary in **The Cobbles**.

### Bonds

Example **Bond** from **The Fields**:  
**Seeds of Fortune**: Your family owes a large sum of money to someone from **The Commons**, who sponsored your latest crop. The harvest failed, and now you must find a way to repay the debt. Until you do, you cannot return home or step foot in **The Cobbles** without risking their wrath.

Example **Bond** from **The Marches**:  
**The Crimson Oath**: You swore a blood oath to a warrior from The Marches, who saved your life in battle. They have called upon you to honor that oath by joining their quest to avenge a fallen comrade. If you break this bond, you will be forever branded a dishonarable coward amongst the people of **The Marches**.

Example **Bond** from **The Marches**:  
**The Sacred Hunt**: A revered beast roams **The Marches**, a symbol of the wild and untamed spirit of the land. You were chosen by the elders to partake in the ritual hunt for this creature. To refuse would be to dishonor your people and bring misfortune upon your kin.

### Omens

Example **Omen** from **The Woods**:  
**The Shattered Grove**: A great oak in the heart of The Woods has been split asunder, signaling the awakening of an ancient forest spirit. It's said that if the spirit's anger is not appeased, a terrible curse will befall the land. You must find a way to mend the broken tree and calm the spirit.

Example **Omen** from **The Fields**:  
**The Howling Shadows**: Strange creatures have been seen stalking the edges of **The Fields**, their haunting cries echoing through the trees. An old prophecy suggests their appearance heralds a great calamity. You must uncover the truth behind the creatures and avert the disaster they portend.
