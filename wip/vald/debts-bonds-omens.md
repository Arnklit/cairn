# Debts, Bonds, Omens

## Introduction

The goal is to encourage party cooperation, further questing, and character growth. Debts, Bonds & Omens should encourage the PCs to:
- Work together
- Make money (e.g. questing)
- Go on an adventure (baked-in quest hook)
- Fulfill an obligation
- Get back their [stuff, reputation, whatever]

## Domains
- Players roll up 3 characters (Two from The Cobbles, one from The Wood).
- **The Cobbles** focus is usually more economic (Debts).
- **The Woods** focus is more on impending doom (Omens).
- **The Marches** focus is more on connecting people, tribe, and land (Bonds).
- **The Fields** focus is on both Bonds and Debts.
- **The Roots** focus... I'm not sure yet. 

## Debts

**The Woods**:  
**The Wooded Dead**: A group of benign Forest Liches  demand you plant a grove of rare (and expensive) **Corpsewood** trees after you (accidentally) trespassed on their sacred grove. The saplings grow wherever the dead rest in great numbers. Until your debt is paid, travelling through **The Woods** is slower, and forest critters shy away from you.  

**The Marches**:  
**The Dawn Brigade**: They helped get you out, asking for only one thing in return: Cross the border. Deep in **The Marches** there is a glade of primrose and ash. In its center is a **Blood Flower**. You have three months to bring it to them before **The Bloodhounds** find you.

**The Cobbles**:  
**The Ironscale Syndicate**: You borrowed money from a notorious criminal organization to cover a desperate need. They expect you to repay the loan with considerable interest. (500gp) Until the debt is paid, their enforcers will hound you, making it difficult to rest or find sanctuary in **The Cobbles**.

**The Fields**:  
**Seeds of Fortune**: Your family owes a large sum of money to a moneylender from **The Cobbles** to sponser a failed crop. With no way to repay the debt, you cannot return home or step foot in **The Cobbles** without risking their wrath.

**The Roots**:  
**The Cost of Freedom**: You paid dearly for a chance to escape **The Roots** and your enemies there. The price remains unpaid, and now your liberators are demanding the fee, plus interest (250gp). It would cost them nothing to throw you down the nearest **Gate** and inform your enemies of your whereabouts. 

### Bonds

**The Marches**:  
**The Crimson Oath**: You swore a blood oath to a warrior who saved your life in battle. They have called upon you to honor that oath by joining their quest to avenge a fallen comrade. If you break this bond, you will be forever branded a dishonarable coward amongst the people of **The Marches**.

**The Marches**:  
**The Sacred Hunt**: A revered beast roams **The Marches**, a symbol of the wild and untamed spirit of the land. You were chosen by the elders to partake in the ritual hunt for this creature. To refuse would be to dishonor your people and bring misfortune upon your kin.

**The Fields**:  
**Famine Relief**: A local village provided you with food and shelter during a time of great need. They expect you to return the favor by finding a solution to the blight that has stricken their crops. 

### Omens

**The Woods**:  
**The Shattered Grove**: A great oak in the heart of The Woods has been split asunder, signaling the awakening of an ancient forest spirit. It's said that if the spirit's anger is not appeased, a terrible curse will befall the land. You must find a way to mend the broken tree and calm the spirit.

**The Fields**:  
**The Howling Shadows**: Strange creatures have been seen stalking the edges of **The Fields**, their haunting cries echoing through the trees. An old prophecy suggests their appearance heralds a great calamity. You must uncover the truth behind the creatures and avert the disaster they portend.
