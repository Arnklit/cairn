## What led you to become a Crop Guardian? Roll 1d6:

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | You come from a long line of Crop Guardians, and your family's farm has always been a bastion of safety for the surrounding community. You carry your ancestor's protective amulet as a symbol of your duty. |
| 2    | As a child, you discovered a sacred grove hidden among the crops, where the spirits of the land whispered secrets to you. You can sense the emotions of plants, allowing you to find the source of blights and other disturbances. |
| 3    | A mysterious wanderer saved your village from a devastating plague and taught you the ancient arts of crop protection. You still have a bundle of strange herbs they gifted you, which can cure diseases in plants and animals alike. |
| 4    | You were once a simple farmer, until you found an ancient artifact buried in your fields that granted you a deeper connection to the land. You now wear a small fragment of the artifact as a pendant, allowing you to communicate with the soil. |
| 5    | Your village was attacked by a terrifying monster that ravaged the fields, and you were the only one brave enough to stand against it. You've since dedicated your life to protecting the crops, carrying the monster's claw as a trophy. |
| 6    | A wise old druid took you in as their apprentice and taught you the secrets of nature magic. Though the druid has passed on, their staff has been passed down to you, enhancing your abilities to protect and nurture the land. |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....

The **Grove of the Eternal Harvest**, an ancient order of druids who hold the knowledge of the world's most powerful plant magic. They demand that you retrieve a rare, long-lost seed from a hidden garden deep within a treacherous forest. Until the debt is paid, their agents will watch your every move, ensuring you stay true to your mission.
