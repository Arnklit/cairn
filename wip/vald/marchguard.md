## Why did you take the Oath?

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Your family has a long tradition of serving. You were trained from an early age how to survive in the wilds. You can forgo **Sleep** for one night without penalty, and you find **d6** rations when taking the **Supply** action.|
| **2** | A convict from **The Cobbles**, you knew nothing of **The Marshes**, only taking the Oath as a means of avoiding death. Take a **hidden throwing knife (d6)**, and the key to a safe hideout back home. |
| **3** | Raised in **The Marshes**, you joined to escape family trouble.  Take a **Goosefelt Tarp** (one slot), a gift of the Marchguard that brought you in. |
| **4** | When your family lost its land rights in **The Fields**, you joined to avoid becoming a burden. Take a pouch of glow-in-the-dark **Emberseeds** whose flowers become highly explosive when planted.    |
| **5** | Your life was saved by the Marchguard and you were inspired to join their ranks. Take a **snare kit** and a sketchbook. |
| **6** | After failing at living in the wilds alone, you figured things might be easier among others. You're still not so sure. Take an **oilskin coat** and **weatherproof mapping paper**. |

## What do you carry that might identify you as an Oathbreaker?

|      |                                  |                                                              |

| 1    | **Guard Pin** | A metal badge bearing the emblem of the border guardians. It can open doors, but leaves a trail. |
| 2    | **Tattered Map** | A fragile scroll marked with the locations of key landmarks and hidden paths along the border. |
| 3    | **Pullstones**   | Two jet-black stones. When separated, the stones will always roll in the direction of the other.  |
| 4    | **Fireflask**  | Highly alcoholic, but strangely delicious. When lit, creates a short-living wall of flames 10ft high. |
| 5    | **Pain Band** | Ttouch an injured creature while wearing it to transfer their wounds to you. They do not regain lost STR, but you do not lose any either. **Recharge**: Someone must die while wearing the ring.  |
| 6    | **Poacher's Woe** | Creatures struck by these arrows leave behind a strong scent you can follow. d8 damage, 5 uses.  |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....

**The Dawn Brigade**. Oathbreakers that do not return by the following dawn are shown mercy. The others must contend with **The Dawn Brigade**, an elite force of silent killers. One of their own was brutally killed while looking for you, and now the others want answers.
