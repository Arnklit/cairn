## Farmhand

> You do not own the land, but you nurture it anyway. Without it, we are all doomed.

## Starting Gear

- Three days' rations
- Torch (3 uses)
- Sickle (d6) or Sledgehammer (d10, bulky)

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 1   | A devastating flood left you indebted, with no means to recover. Take a satchel of **farm repair tools** (bulky).                                                                       |
| 2   | You left a scholarship in **The Cobbles** for the rustic life, but quickly ran out of money. Take a surprisingly good **handwritten guide to farming**.                                 |
| 3   | You uncovered a **Gate** beneath the soil. Something unsettling came out of it, and those crops are dead, now. Take extra **rations**, and a sense of dread.                            |
| 4   | The farm was overwhelmed by invaders from **The Marches**, forcing you to flee. Take a **hunter's bow** (d6) you stole from someone who didn't need it anymore.                         |
| 5   | Your impressive harvest won you the favor of a noble in **The Cobbles**, until a competitor sabotaged your reputation. Take a scroll of _Plant Scourge_, and a wanted poster.           |
| 6   | A traveler who told you tales of adventure and excitement, then vanished under mysterious circumstances. Take a **regional map**; one spot is marked **G** with a skull and crossbones. |


## What do you carry that brings you luck?

|     |                        |                                                                                                |

| 1   | **Cookbook**           | A family-style cookbook that always brings delights to those that eat of its recipes.          |
| 2   | **Heirloom Tool**      | A simple farming tool passed down through generations.                                         |
| 3   | **Iron Gourd**         | A small trinket that someone close to you believed brings good fortune and bountiful harvests. |
| 4   | **Seed Pouch**         | A pouch of mixed seeds from the best harvest you've ever had. They are worth 20gp to a farmer. |
| 5   | **Nightshade Pendant** | A silver amulet that protects the wearer by turning purple near anything toxic.                |
| 6   | **Leather Gloves**     | A pair of well-worn gloves for ripping weeds, thorns, or worse from between the crops.         |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, you are in Debt to....

**Garik**, a powerful trader who supplied you with exotic seeds when your crops were wiped out by disease. In return, they have asked you to venture into **The Roots** to acquire a rare "moving" fungi called a **Strollshroom**.
