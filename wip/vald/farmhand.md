## Farmhand

> You do not own the land, but you nurture it anyway. Without it, we are all doomed.

## Starting Gear

- Three days' rations
- Torch (3 uses)
- Sickle (d6) or Sledgehammer (d10, bulky)

|      |                                                              |

| 1    | A devastating flood left you indebted, with no means to recover. Take a satchel of **farm repair tools** (bulky). |
| 2    | You left a scholarship in **The Cobbles** for the rustic life, but quickly ran out of money. Take a surprisingly good **handwritten guide to farming**. |
| 3    | You uncovered a **Gate** beneath the soil. Something unsettling came out of it, and those crops are dead, now. Take extra **rations**, and a sense of dread.  |
| 4    | The farm was overwhelmed by invaders from **The Marches**, forcing you to flee. Take a **hunter's bow** (d6) you stole from someone who didn't need it anymore. |
| 5    | Your impressive harvest won you the favor of a noble in **The Cobbles**, until a competitor sabotaged your reputation. Take a pouch of **rare seeds** (d20gp). |
| 6    | A traveler who told you tales of adventure and excitement, then vanished under mysterious circumstances. Take a **regional map**; one spot is marked **G** with a skull and crossbones.  |


## What do you carry that might identify you?

| 3    | **Lucky Charm**         | A small trinket or charm that you believe brings good fortune and bountiful harvests. It's a symbol of your faith in the land and your connection to its cycles. |
| 4    | **Handwritten Journal** | A journal filled with notes, sketches, and observations about the land, crops, and animals. It's a testament to your knowledge and dedication to farming. |
