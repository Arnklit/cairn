# Setting

## Introduction
- The implied setting of Cairn is comprised of the following **Domains**: **The Cobbles**, **The Fields**, **The Woods**, **The Marches**, and **The Roots**.
- **Domains** are not necessarily bound to a specific geography: **The Woods** is not one forest, but _all_ forests, for example. 
- Your own setting is not limited these particular **Domains**; one could just as easily have **The Rivers** or **The Seas**.

## The Cobbles

- An urban seat of power that uses its advanced technology, wealth, and might to bring the people of **The Fields** and **The Woods** to heel whenever necessary.
- As self-styled "centers of civilization", the people of **The Cobbles** are vast and sundry, reflecting the fulcrum of culture and education in the region.
- To ensure the continued flow of food and goods, the wealthier denizens of **The Cobbles** ensure that any connected roads or footpaths are maintained and patrolled by soldiers, militia, or local champions.

## The Fields

- Any farms, orchards, or meadows that owe a tax or tithe to **The Cobbles** in exchange for cultivation "rights" over land and unprotected forests.
- The people of **The Fields** are generally tougher folks than those of **The Cobbles**, and are equally as diverse. What they lack in education they make up for in practical skills, and their connection to the land and its natural history.
- Alliances between the various factions of **The Fields** are not uncommon, but rarely long-lasting. There are murmors of an alliance with the Sea, River, and Wood folk, but to speak openly about such things is considered foolish as well as dangerous.

## The Woods

- Any untamed forested terrain. All forests are considered part of **The Woods**, no matter how isolated.
- The Woods are populated by creatures far stranger and wondrous than humankind: Fae, Demons, Witches, werewolves, and even talking plants and animals. They do not appreciate the loss of their home from the encroachment of **The Cobbles**, either. 
- The denizens of **The Woods** are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to the rules of **The Woods** and no other.

## The Marches

- Any lands beyond the control of **The Cobbles**. Typically wilder and less "civilized."
- Its fierce nations, wild tribes, and unrelenting elements have kept the armies and scouting parties of **The Cobbles** at bay. For now.
- Ancient texts indicate that **The Marches** were once a great power in the **Old World**, and that their technology and magic may still be hidden in its ruins.

## The Roots

- Remnants of the **Old World**, its labyrinthine hollows stretching for immeasurable distances deep underground, connecting the sewers of **The Cobbles** to the far-flung ruins of **The Marches**. Entrances to **The Roots** (called **Gates**) are scattered across the lands, and are usually protected or shrewdly hidden.
- Only the brave or foolish have dared enter **The Roots**, in search of forgotten **Relics** or powerful **Spellbooks**. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures.
- Folktales recount that traveling through **The Roots** bends the natural order of things. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries to the depths, only to emerge again claiming that only a few hours have passed. Others have claimed to make a week-long journey above ground in just one day, traveling in the tunnels beneath.
