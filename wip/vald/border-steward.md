## Why did you join the Border Stewards?

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Your family has a long tradition of serving. You were trained from an early age how to survive in the wilds. You can forgo **Sleep** for one night without penalty, and you find **d6** rations when taking the **Supply** action.|
| **2** | A convict from **The Cobbles**, you knew nothing of **The Marshes**, only taking the Oath as a means of avoiding death. Take a **hidden throwing knife (d6)**, and a key to somewhere safe you can hide if you need it. |
| **3** | Raised in **The Marshes**, you left everything you knew to become a **Steward**, in the hopes that your life would turn out better on the other side of the border. Take a **Goosefelt Tarp** (one slot), a gift of the **Steward** that brought you in. |
| **4** | When your family lost its land rights in **The Fields**, you joined to avoid becoming a burden. Take a sack of seeds your mother gave you, and a pair of shears.    |

## Why did you break your Oath? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | You were falsely accused of a crime and forced to leave, but you managed to take a valuable map of secret border crossings with you. |
| **2** | You fell in love with someone who lived outside the border, and you decided to follow your heart. You learned a unique herbal remedy from your lover. |
| **3** | You sustained a serious injury that forced you to retire, but during your recovery, you befriended a skilled blacksmith who taught you how to maintain and repair weapons. |
| **4** | You discovered corruption within the border guard, and after exposing the culprits, you decided to strike out on your own. You gained a contact within the Marches' criminal underworld. |
| **5** | A spiritual experience led you to question your path, and you left the Watch to seek greater wisdom. You acquired a rare tome of ancient knowledge. |
| **6** | You were offered a more lucrative position elsewhere, but you couldn't forget your roots. You left with a powerful enchanted compass that always points to the nearest border. |

## What did you see that drove you from The Watch? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | You witnessed a terrifying creature from the depths of The Roots emerge and attack a nearby village. In the aftermath, you found an odd, glowing crystal with mysterious properties. |
| **2** | You stumbled upon a hidden grove where fey creatures danced and played, but their magic left you feeling lost and disconnected from your duties. They gifted you a charm that brings good fortune. |
| **3** | You saw a powerful sorcerer summon a demon to do their bidding, leading you to question the nature of good and evil. As you fled, you managed to grab a tome of forbidden arcane knowledge. |
| **4** | While patrolling the border, you came across a field of strange, luminescent flowers. These flowers revealed hidden truths and caused you to doubt the Watch's purpose. You took a handful of seeds to plant elsewhere. |
| **5** | You discovered an ancient ruin buried beneath the land, filled with the ghosts of a long-lost civilization. One of the spirits gave you an enchanted amulet that can calm restless souls. |
| **6** | You encountered a group of outlaws who revealed the suffering caused by the Watch's actions. Unable to reconcile your beliefs with their stories, you left the Watch and took a beautifully crafted dagger gifted to you by the outlaws. |

## What do you carry that might identify you?

|      |                                  |                                                              |
