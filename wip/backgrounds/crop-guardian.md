## What drew you from your duties? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A voracious pest threatened the land, and you were unable to eradicate them. Take a vial of **sprayable poison** (4 STR damage, _blast_).                                                                                              |
| **2** | You were sent to retrieve some rare and expensive components for a potentially invaluable pesticide. Take **explosive putty**.                                                                                                         |
| **3** | A fellow guardian was slain and you must tell their only kin, a silent monk who lives deep in **The Woods**. Take their blood-stained **bone knife** (d8).                                                                             |
| **4** | The crops are dying, but no one knows why. You were sent to find answers. Take a **diseased crop** that decays any plant it touches.                                                                                                   |
| **5** | Their howls drew you deep into **The Woods**; you were hurt but did not die. You are a **werewolf** [15 STR, claws (d6+d6) or bite (d8)]. You turn at least once a month, or when making a critical damage save (affects still apply). |
| **6** | You failed your charge, and were sent away. Now you take work where you can find it. You were always good with a blade. Take a **hilted broadsword** (d8).                                                                             |

## What tool of the trade do you always carry? Roll 1d6:

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Bloodvine Whip** | Does d8 damage up to 12ft away. On Critical damage it drains the target's blood. For the rest of combat its damage is _enhanced_.             |
| **2** | **Clatter Keeper** | A hand-cranked device that emits a loud noise, frightening away most creatures.                                                               |
| **3** | **Sun Stick**      | When exposed to complete darkness, provides ample warmth and light for up to one hour. **Recharge**: Leave in heavy sunlight for a full day.  |
| **4** | **Root Tether**    | When thrown, binds a wolf-sized creature to the soil for a short time.                                                                        |
| **5** | **Greenwhistle**   | A small flute that calms plants, allowing you passage without needing to cut through first.                                                   |
| **6** | **Everbloom Band** | A circlet adorned with flowers that never wilt, lest they are removed from the wrist. While wearing it, you cannot die. You can still suffer. |
