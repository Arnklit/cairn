## What drew you from your duties? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A voracious pest threatened the land, and you were unable to eradicate them. Take a vial of **sprayable poison** (4 STR damage, _blast_).                                                                                              |
| **2** | You were sent to retrieve some rare and expensive components for a potentially invaluable pesticide. Take **explosive putty**.                                                                                                         |
| **3** | A fellow guardian was slain and you must tell their only kin, a silent monk who lives deep in **The Woods**. Take their blood-stained **bone knife** (d8).                                                                             |
| **4** | The crops are dying, but no one knows why. You were sent to find answers. Take a **diseased crop** that decays any plant it touches.                                                                                                   |
| **5** | Their howls drew you deep into **The Woods**; you were hurt but did not die. You are a **werewolf** [15 STR, claws (d6+d6) or bite (d8)]. You turn at least once a month, or when making a critical damage save (affects still apply). |
| **6** | You failed your charge, and were sent away. Now you take work where you can find it. You were always good with a blade. Take a **hilted broadsword** (d8).                                                                             |

## What tool of the trade do you always carry? Roll 1d6:

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Bloodvine Whip** | Does d8 damage up to 12ft away. On Critical damage it drains the target's blood. For the rest of combat its damage is _enhanced_.             |
| **2** | **Clatter Keeper** | A hand-cranked device that emits a loud noise, frightening away most creatures.                                                               |
| **3** | **Sun Stick**      | When exposed to complete darkness, provides ample warmth and light for up to one hour. **Recharge**: Leave in heavy sunlight for a full day.  |
| **4** | **Root Tether**    | When thrown, binds a wolf-sized creature to the soil for a short time.                                                                        |
| **5** | **Greenwhistle**   | A small flute that calms plants, allowing you passage without needing to cut through first.                                                   |
| **6** | **Everbloom Band** | A circlet adorned with flowers that never wilt, lest they are removed from the wrist. While wearing it, you cannot die. You can still suffer. |

## Who or what binds you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | A **wealthy noble**, after you accidentally destroyed their priceless collection of ancient wine. What you can't repay in gold, you must repay in service. Take a **lapel of vassalhood**. |
| **2** | A **pond spirit**, after it saved you from drowning at a local swimming hole. Now you dream of a great swan circling an eye-shaped pool, somewhere deep in **The Woods**. The dreams are becoming more urgent each day. Take a **lily pad** that never dries. |
| **3** | A **greenwise**, after she healed an ill family member. In lieu of payment she asked that you perform a similar act on behalf of **The Woods** before the year is out. You have 15 days remaining. Take fragrant **dried herbs**. |
| **4** | A **local militia leader** who spared you from punishment. He asked that you never walk his road again. It is very inconvenient. Take a **small brand** on your wrist. |
| **5** | You saw your grandfather's spirit walking into the wheat after he died. Later, you kept **a loaf of bread** made from its harvest. It has never gone stale, and you feel his ever-watchful eye. |
| **6** | As a child you became lost in the woods, where you met a grey-skinned men with cool blue eyes. He told you he was a prince, and asked you to join him in his kingdom. You refused, but he was not angry. Now you carry his **ring**. You have since never met harm in **The Woods**, save for when you forgot it.           |
