| **1** | An ill-tempered spirit cursed you for stealing its heart-seed. Now any plant you touch wilts and dies. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. Ingesting it cures any poison (one use, unless retrieved). Roll on the **Bonds** table. |
| **2** | Grief over a friend's death follows you, their face appearing in any any tea you brew. Take a **soporific concoction**. Roll on the **Bonds** table.                                   |
| **3** | An accidental poisoning cost you your sense of taste and smell, but you can now withstand noxious fumes. Take a **book on dangerous plants**. Roll on the **Omens** table.|
| **4** | Your radical experiments altered you; you now subsist on only copious amounts of sun and water. Instead of rations, you carry a **fortified jug of water** (bulky). Roll on the **Omens** table.       |
| **5** | Your impressive corpseflower won a contest in **The Cobbles**, then promptly killed a judge. You fled, but not without **the prize money (100gp)**. Roll on the **Bonds** table.              |
| **6** | A restorative tincture you brewed caused accidental infertility in a powerful client. Take a **healing potion** that completely restores STR. Only you know of its unintended side-effects. Roll on the **Bonds** table.    |
