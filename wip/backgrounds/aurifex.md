|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**   |                       |
| **2** | Your mentor died in a tragic accident, just as you were on the cusp of a major discovery. You survived, but not unscathed: you can _smell gold_, even rooms away. The sense is so powerful it overwhelms everything else. Take a **tin of snuff**. You are _deprived_ without it.          |
| **3** | You accidentally brewed a love potion for a client, an heir to a local position of nobility. They were infatuated with you, but their parents had other ideas. With the proper ingredients, you know how to make the _Shroud_ potion (take one now).                                       |
| **4** | You are followed by a homunculus, a small 6-inch replica of yourself. You created it, and it hates being enthralled to you. Though it will follow your commands to the letter, it will try to undo your requests whenever possible. Any damage done to the homunculus is also done to you. |
| **5** | You discovered evidence that someone - you don't know who - was slowly experimenting on you. Occasionally you experience terrifying visions of the future. You rarely feel hunger and need only eat every 3 days. Take antitoxin.                                                          |
| **6** | The last concoction you brewed resulted in a massive explosion, scarring you horribly. Most folk will look away from whatever you're up to. You can walk handle fire for small spurts without taking injury. Take fire oil.                                                                |


|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7** | You crafted a tonic that accidentally amplified the consumer's worst traits. The local town was thrown into chaos, and you were blamed. Shunned, you stopped practicing. Now, you can immediately identify any person's dominant character trait on sight. Take a vial of clear water, the base of all your potions. |
| **8** | You made an elixir of youth for a wealthy patron. It worked too well, reducing them to an infant. Fleeing their wrath, you swore off your craft. But, you age slower now, adding 10 years to your lifespan. Start with a baby rattle, a reminder of your mistake. |
| **9** |  |
| **10** | A rival tricked you into creating a deadly poison, resulting in several deaths. Riddled with guilt, you abandoned your craft. However, you've become immune to common poisons. Start with a snake fang, a symbol of your past. |
| **11** | Your attempts to transmute lead into gold resulted in a blinding flash. You regained sight after a week, but now, you see precious metals as dull and worthless. Start with a worthless lead nugget, a testament to your failure. |
| **12** | You sought the perfect healing salve, but only managed to create a powerful hallucinogen. After an unplanned "trip", you quit. Now, psychedelic experiences don't affect you. Start with a bundle of dried herbs, ingredients for that disastrous salve. |

| 1   | **Alchemist's Fire**          | A clay bottle filled with sticky green fluid that catches fire when exposed to air. Counts a bottle of burning oil without needing to lit.                                  |
| 2   | **Bomb**                      | Head-sized iron ball filled with explosive powder with an attached wick. Deals 1d12 [blast](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#blast) damage.                                  |

| 4   | **Tincture Of Truth-Talking** | Only a few drops remain, enough for one dose. This tasteless clear liquid will compel whoever ingests it to answer questions truthfully for d6 \* 10 minutes.               |
| 5   | **Magnesium Shavings**        | A pouch containing d6 uses that will easily ignite and burn intensely.                                                                                                      |
| 6   | **Basic Alchemist's Kit**     | A wooden chest filled with four corked glass vials and stand, a small bronze weight scale, pestle & mortar, stirring rods, a bottle of solvent, and a pouch of salt. Bulky. |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....
The **Order of the Merciful Balance**, a shadowy group of alchemists, scholars, and their occult followers.
