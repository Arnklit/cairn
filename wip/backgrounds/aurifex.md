|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **1** | Your attempts to transmute lead ended in tragedy. You survived, but lost your sense of smell, with one exception: the scent of nearby **gold** is almost overpowering. Take a **tin of snuff** to drown it out. A day without it makes you _deprived_.                             |
| **2** | You lost your credentials after inadvertently dematerializing a noble's beloved pet. Now the creature follows you around, invisible to everyone but you. Although it cannot interact with the physical realm, you are able to share its senses at any time (take one **Fatigue**). |
| **3** | You were exposed to a vial of long-acting truth serum. Now, you compulsively speak the truth, and cannot lie. You carry a **Rod of Silence** (3 charges). It cancels all magical effects, including your affliction. **Recharge**: Complete a vow of silence for one week.         |
| **4** |                                                                                                     |
| **5** |                                                                                                     |
| **6** |                                                                                               |

| ----- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Alchemist's Fire**          | A clay bottle filled with sticky green fluid that catches fire when exposed to air. Counts a bottle of burning oil without needing to lit.                                                                                                |
| **2** | **Bomb**                      | Head-sized iron ball filled with explosive powder with an attached wick. Deals 1d12 [blast](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#blast) damage.                                                                                                |
| **3** | **Vial of Acid**              | Can disintegrate 1 cubic inch of any surface.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **4** | **Mimic Stone** |  Records a short phrase that can later be played back, once.            |
| **5** | **Magnesium Shavings**        | A pouch containing d6 uses that will easily ignite and burn intensely.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **6** | **Homunculus**                | An animated mouse-sized replica of yourself. Though it follows your commands to the letter, it hates being enthralled to you and will try to undo your requests whenever possible. Any damage done to the homunculus is also done to you. |
