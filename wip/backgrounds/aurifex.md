|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **1** | Your attempts to transmute lead ended in tragedy. You survived, but lost your sense of smell, with one exception: the scent of nearby **gold** is almost overpowering. Take a **tin of snuff** to drown it out. A day without it makes you _deprived_.                                                                   |
| **2** | You lost your credentials after inadvertently dematerializing a noble's beloved pet. Now the creature follows you around, invisible to everyone but you. Although it cannot interact with the physical realm, you are able to share its senses at any time (take one **Fatigue**).                                       |
| **3** | You were exposed to a vial of long-acting truth serum. Now, you compulsively speak the truth, and cannot lie. You carry a **Rod of Silence** (3 charges). It cancels all magical effects, including your affliction. **Recharge**: Complete a vow of silence for one week.                                               ||            
| **4** | You never learned to actually transmute metals into gold. Instead, you became adept at creating _fake_ gold. Once your ruse was discovered however you were forced to flee. Take a **rod of quick-flow metal** and **gold powder**.                                                                                      |
| **5** | Your recipe for turning iron to gold worked, but before your invention was made public a rival stole the blueprint and used their newfound wealth to destroy your reputation. You know you could try again, but you lack the funds and feel clouded by anger. Take a one-shot **blunderbuss** (**d12**, _blast_, bulky). |
| **6** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **4** | **Mimic Stone**        | Records a short phrase that can later be played back, once.                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **6** | **Homunculus**         | An animated mouse-sized replica of yourself. Though it follows your commands to the letter, it hates being enthralled to you and will try to undo your requests whenever possible. Any damage done to the homunculus is also done to you. |
