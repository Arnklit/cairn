## What drove you from caring for the dead? Roll 1d6:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Witness** | Shadowy, inhuman figures interrupted the private burial of a wealthy noble, taking the corpse and murdering the mourners. You were left alive to bare witness, but fled for fear of reprisal. Later, you found a **crow-shaped token** in your pocket. Once per day, you may ask a fresh corpse three questions, and receive answers in return. The dead do not necessarily speak the truth. |
| 2    |**Marked** | You opened a forgotten crypt, releasing the long-dormant revenant trapped within. You survived, but your face was scarred, forever marking you as a pariah. Your physical form is now trapped in a state between life and death; you no longer require rations, nor do you need to breathe, but you can still be killed. You always wear a helm (1 Armor) to cover the scar, lest the living attack you on sight. The dead see you as one of their own.   |
| 3    |**Cult of Blood** | You were involved in a death cult, but fled after failing to pay the ultimate sacrifice to the head Lich. Your formerly-living brethren are still in pursuit, their power growing by the day. Take a **Blood Pail**. Pour its contents into a mound of dirt to raise a Shambling Warrior (6 HP, 1 Armor, 13 STR, 11 DEX, 4 WIL). The creature is built of the objects buried below (bones, farming implements, etc). If it is destroyed, you permanently lose 1 STR. **Recharge**: Feed it the blood of a dying enemy.   |
| 4    |**Robbed** |      |
| 5    |**Overburdened** |      |
| 6    |**Intoxicated** |      |
