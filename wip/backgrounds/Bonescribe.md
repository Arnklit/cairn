## Why did you stop caring for the dead? Roll 1d6:

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Inhuman figures stole a noble's corpse, killing the attended mourners but leaving you alive. They left you **crow-shaped token** that lets you ask one question of the dead (take 1 Fatigue). Don't assume the Dead speak truly. |
| 2    | You released a long-dormant **Revenant** from a forgotten tome. The experienced scarred you, and made you a pariah amongst the living. You no longer breathe, nor do you require food. Of course, you can still die, but the dead now see you as one of their own. |
| 3    | You fled a death cult after getting cold feet. Your (now undead) brethren are still in pursuit, and their master's power is growing by the day. Take a **Blood Pail** (_bulky_). Empty its contents to summon a creature built of objects buried below (bones, rocks, pottery, etc). The **Shambler** (6 HP, 1 Armor, 13 STR, 11 DEX, 4 WIL, shard fists (d8)) obeys your command but if destroyed _permanently_ subtracts 1 STR. **Recharge**: Fill the bucket with the blood of the dying. |
| 4    | Obviously, the graveyard was haunted: everyone knew that. What you _didn't know_ was that the place was frequented by lycanthropes, meeting in great packs each month atop the hill. Fortunately you came prepared, but that wasn't enough - a scratch was all it took. You killed the blasted thing, but still a cure eludes you. Now you *shift* each full moon (WIL save to maintain control while changed) or when grievously injured (you lose control). While changed you appear as a very large wolf: 8 HP, 15 STR, 14 DEX, 6 WIL, claws (d6+d6) or bite (d8). Any left alive from your bite must make a WIL save to avoid infection. |
| 5    | You took the job as a temporary measure, a first step towards wealth. Your role was simple: play as a grave tender, cleaning the family's tombs and taking care of the shrubbery. And on the date indicated let your friends into the family vault. You did your part, but your friends were caught and thrown in prison! Now you're on the run, your old life left behind forever. But it wasn't a total loss: you escaped with the getaway wagon (+8 slots, slow) and a stubborn old donkey (+4 slots, slow). If attached to the wagon, the donkey only holds +2 slots. |
| 6    | Your family acted as caretakers for the dead, but only to those who worshipped their ancient, obscure deity. You were taught the rituals and principles of that faith, and for a time it brought meaning and purpose. As you grew older, a bitter realization wedged itself between you and your family: you no longer believed in their god. They cursed you for it, casting you out forever. Take a staff (d6) and the [_Frozen Corpse_](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#frozen-corpse) spellbook. |

## What did you take from the deceased? Roll 1d6:

|      |               |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Manacles**  | Old, but still pretty effective, even against the very strong. You don't have the key. |
| 2    | **Sponge**    | Made of some incredible material, supposedly from an elusive sea creature. It never seems to get dry. Worth 50gp to the right person. |
| 3    | **Pulley**    | Great for heaving gravestones, rocks, or even bodies.        |
| 4    | **Incense**   | Perfect for rituals, or to keep the flies at bay. Cools the blood. |
| 5    | **Crowbar**   | Sometimes you just need to get the damn thing open!          |
| 6    | **Repellent** | Powerful stuff. You're not sure what it is actually _meant_ to repell though, as the writing is faded. Maybe everything? 3 uses. |
