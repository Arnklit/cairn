## How was your fraud exposed?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | **Natural Talent** | Too many of your "patients" were reporting a complete recovery from their ailments, and your name grew famous as a result (much to your chagrin). Somehow, you were a half-decent doctor (or incredibly lucky). Obviously you had no option but to leave in search of fresh prospects. Start with bandages, ointment and a halfway decent sense of what's wrong with someone (3-in-6 chance). |  
| 2 | **Betrayal** | Flush from your latest seduction, a wealthy widow/er - you disappeared to the usual place. Unfortunately, the spurned lover and their descendents hired a reknowned criminal gang (known associates, naturally) to ambush and bring you back. Your former "friends" tied you up and beat you senseless, but failed to account for your exceptional contortionist skills. Soon you were free, but penniless. At least you still have your looks, as well your talents. You can wriggle out of nearly anything (literally, or through charm).   |
| 3    |**Cursed** | You can mimic another's mannerisms, voice, and speech pattern perfectly within seconds of meeting them. You do this effortlessly, almost unconsciously. In fact, you've never felt at home in your own skin, and are prone to bouts of shivering, shaking, and _deprivation_ if you go more than a day without practicing your craft. Friendships are difficult to maintain, as they often end in anger, or confusion after learning who you really are, and what you can do. Now you travel through the land, looking for the cure you fear will never come. Take a makeup kit (bulky). |
| 4    |**Rashness** | Your mother was a reknowned actor, famed for her skill and wit. She died when you were quite young, but still it seems that you've inherited her talents. You can play the part of the wise military general, the gregarious merchant, the slack-jawed farmer, or any other assortment of archetypes, should the mood strike you. You are also a compulsive risk-taker and provocateur, relishing adventure and excitement over common sense. Your latest plots went quite poorly, resulting in a memorable escape from prison, right beneath the noses of the city watch. You start with a captain's uniform, a _harmless_ ceremonial sword (bulky) worth 60 gold pieces, and a boquet of flowers.    |
| 5    |**True Magic** | You've a knack for sleight of hand magic: card tricks, coins behind the ear, disappearing pigs, etc. Occassionaly you'd even pass it off as the real thing if it means a place in court.      |
| 6    |**** |      |

## What do you carry that might identify you?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Royal Crest** | In truth, you were born into royalty. A life of crime just seemed more... interesting. You can never go back now, not after what the things you've done. Used sparingly, this token of your former status opens a lot of doors, among other things. Of course, your family has eyes everywhere, and they want it back.   |
| 2    |**Pop's World-Famous Miracle Oil** | Your father - your _real_ father, that is - travelled from town to town, selling his strange, smelly homemade concoction as a miracle cure, sword cleaner, or even as salad dressing. You can't bring yourself to rid of it. It is very, very, slippery.         |

1. **A Very Vicious Pug:** You often dressed it up in fake leathery wings and mock horns, then you'd "exorcise" the little imp with ancient chants and hidden sausages.
2. **Rock Oil:** One pint of a grease that only lubricates minerals.
3. **Cassiel's Clever Cure:** A potion that will cure any disease, but unfortunately causes a different, completely random one.
4. **Soap:** A by-product of your usual platform, you have a nearly endless supply of lye.
5. **Invisibility Balm:** One tin of an amazing lotion that will turn one individual invisible. The user's skin becomes completely transparent, but the skeleton and organs remain opaque.
