## How did your lose your fortune?

| 1    |**Unwilling Torturer** | You were an expert crafter, shaping metal into any form imaginable. Your trade was so sought-after thta it attracted the attention of a wealthy patron, who offered you a year's sum to fashion a small part of a great machine. You later learned that the machine was a devious torture implement on behalf of the  **Guild of Torturers**. Worse yet, your patron was murdered by a subordinate before payment was dispersed! Word spread; eventually you were forced to close up shop. You always carry pincers, hammer, and tin. With enough time, you can turn the metal into nearly anything.   |
