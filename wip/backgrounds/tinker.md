## How did your lose your way?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Accomplice** | A well-respected tinsmith, your skill attracted the attention of a wealthy patron who offered you a year's pay to design a miniscule part from spec. You learned later that your handiwork was was found in a vault-cracking device used by the **Guild of Thieves, Scoundrels and Wastrels**, your signature scrived within. Your property seized, you fled to avoid imprisonment (or worse). You always carry pincers, a hammer, and tin. Given time and materials, you can open almost any door. |
| 2    |**Persecuted** | You made a living traveling from town to town, selling home goods, tools, and the like. You didn't stuck around long enough to make friends, but enemies seemed to pop-up almost everywhere: superstitious peasants, greedy nobles, or wicked zealots. Some whispered on the devilish origins of your people, while others simply made your kind a bogeymen for their daily ills. Eventually it became too dangerous to keep up the family trade, so you found a new path for yourself. You start with a  hidden stiletto (0 slots), a lantern, and oil. You are fluent in the *Traveller's Cant* and its signs; if there is a city within 3 days' walk, you can always find it. |
| 3    |**Peace** | Your folk were smelters, taking raw mineral and making it stronger, more flexible. And during the war, bronze was in high demand - as were your services. But once the war ended, so did your family's livelihood. You and your seven siblings split what was left and spread across the lands in search of the next profitable mineral beneath the earth's crust. Take a smelting hammer (d10, bulky) and tinker's paste (seals a fist-sized opening, 1 use). Given time and adequete materials, you can repair or even *augment* armor, increasing its strength and resiliency. You can identify refined metals and their properties.  |
| 4    |**Ignorance** | You sold only the most rare or unique items: scholarly books, scientific tools, and mechanical wonders. Monasteries and religious houses were your most important customer, before the inquisition began, before the "trials" against demonic possession... You escaped with what little you could grab, and deep down you know the witchfinders are still hunting for you. Take a spyglass, and the [Fold Portal](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#fold-portal) spellbook.     |
| 5    |**Comfort** |  You aren't a tinker, not really. You don't have a head for numbers, or a heart for the sale. Your skill lay instead in the art of self-defense, of killing. You'd travel to and fro with the tinker's, protecting their wares and keeping their company. In time they became like family to you. But you became too comfortable, and let your guard down when it really counted. Your caravan was robbed and someone close to you was killed. Now they're gone, and you're looking for work. Take a long sword (d10, bulky), brigandine (1 Armor), and a helmet (+1 Armor). |
| 6    |**** |  During the war you became nought more than a scavenger, scouring the bloody grasses and burning forests for tin and iron mere hours after the armies had moved out, their casualties still twitching. The horrors you saw in the battlefields still haunt you to this day. After the war ended, you vowed never to dishonor the dead again, donating regular alms to funeraries and their ilk. Start with a donkey (+4 slots, slow), a crossbow (d8 damage, bulky), holy water, a saw, and a debt you can never repay.       |

## What were able to hold on to?

| 1    |**** | a bag of small iron pellets     |
| 2    |**** | abacus    |
| 3    |**** |      |
| 4    |**** |      |
| 5    |**** |      |
| 6    |**** |      |
