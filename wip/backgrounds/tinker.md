## How did your lose your way?

| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Accomplice** | A well-respected tinsmith, your skill attracted the attention of a wealthy patron who offered you a year's pay to design a miniscule part from spec. You learned later that your handiwork was was found in a vault-cracking device used by the **Guild of Thieves, Scoundrels and Wastrels**, your signature scrived within. Your property seized, you fled to avoid imprisonment (or worse). You always carry pincers, a hammer, and tin. Given time and materials, you can open almost any door. |
| 2    |**Persecuted** | You made a living traveling from town to town, selling home goods, tools, and the like. You never stuck around long enough to make friends, but enemies seemed to pop-up almost everywhere: superstitious peasants, greedy nobles, or wicked zealots. Some whispered on the devilish origins of your people, while others simply made your kind a bogeymen for their daily ills. Eventually it became too dangerous to keep up the family trade, so you found a new path for yourself. You start with a  hidden stiletto (0 slots), a lantern, and oil. You are fluent in the *Traveller's Cant* and its signs; if there is a city within 3 days' walk, you can always find it. |
| 3    |**Peace** | Your folk were smelters, taking raw mineral and making it stronger, more flexible. And during the war, bronze was in high demand - as were your services. But once the war ended, so did your family's livelihood. You and your seven siblings split what was left and spread across the lands in search of the next profitable mineral beneath the earth's crust. Take a smelting hammer (d10, bulky) and tinker's paste (seals a fist-sized opening, 1 use). Given time and adequete materials, you can repair or even *augment* armor, increasing its strength and resiliency. You can identify refined metals and their properties.  |
