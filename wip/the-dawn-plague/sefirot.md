# Sefirot

## Details throughout:
- Letters and symbols are carved above nearly every doorway (translation in **Bold**), indicating the room's function and spiritual value.
- The smell of dried mud, decay and burnt-out candles.
- The walls of most rooms are made of earthen clay.

## Upper Level
### 1. The Pedestal (**The Crown**)
- The stairs descend from the **Schul** a large hexagonal room. The walls are unpainted and marred with broken clay, as if purposefully left unshaped.
- A beautifully-wrought statue of a broken circle stands on a pedestal in the center of the room.
- The sculpture appears to face the viewer no matter where in the room they stand. A series of mirrors are positioned in each corner create the illusion; the object's true location is high up in the ceiling.  
- The **South** exit is blocked by a wall of brackish mud nearly 8 feet high. Halfway up there is a hole large enough to fit two arms through. The tunnel beyond appears dark. The lettering on top is smudged and broken.   
- To the **West** is an exit with no carvings above the doorway, but beyond the tunnel walls are lined with a swirling maelstrom of letters covering nearly every inch, with no conceivable meaning. It leads to the  to the **Workshop**.
- The tunnel **East** leads to the **Courtyard**. The archway above contains the symbol of a closed eye. It smells of dead flowers; the sounds of rushing water echo throughout.

### 2. Central Tunnel

### 2a.  

### 3. The Workshop (**Understanding**)
- The walls are painted a vibrant green; the room smells like smoke and sweat.
- A workshop crammed with desks and tools. Some of the tables are filled with miniature, half-built golems.
- It is difficult to move around without pushing the furniture around (and making a lot of noise in the process).
- A highly detailed human brain is skillfully etched onto the cavern wall. Below the diagram is a small bucket filled with grubby water and some drawing tools.
- Stairs on the **South** side go to the **Outer Chamber**
- On the **South-East** side is staircase going down to the **Lower Level** (see the **Treasury**).

### 4. The Courtyard (**Wisdom**)
- The walls are painted blue. The pleasant sound of water echoes throughout the room.  
- In the center of the room is a bubbling fountain; its middle a statue obscured by wilted vines. Removing the plants reveals that the statue has both male and female genitalia.
- In the fountain's basin are three large stones, shaped into smooth ovals. They are eggs left by the **Alukah**; they will hatch soon, then spread onto the surface. They are slightly warm.
- In the **South-West** corner is staircase going down to the **Lower Level**, exiting into the **Treasury**. The archway is imbued with carvings of wealth and excess.
  - On the **South** wall is a water vein large enough for a person to crawl through, single-file. The shaft leads to the **Burial Chamber** . There are no markings around it.  

#### 4a. Water Vein
- A muddy corridor that dips gradually into the **Lower Level**, exiting into the **Burial Chamber**.
-

## Lower Level
### 5. The Court (**Discipline**)
- The walls here are painted red.
- A dais. Symbols of ritual/rites; judgment.
- Wooden poles & parchment

### 6. The Burial Chamber (**Grace**)
- The walls here are painted white.
- A 10-foot long platform is installed into the earth. A massive Golem lies flat and lifeless on the table. Its forehead has smudged lettering on it.
- Four wooden arms are attached to the platform and enclose the body. Careful observation will reveal that they are all right-arms.
- A shaft on the **North** side brings water into the room from the **Courtyard**, where it splits into three smaller conduits that line and bisect the room, each ending in identical 2-foot wide shafts on the **Southeast** corner. The water flows from here into the **Pool of Life**.
- **Engine Room**
- **Splendor**

## Bottom Level
### 7. The Treasury (**Glory**)
- The walls here are painted purple.
- A chamber of souls.
- Dybbuks?

### 8. The Shrine (**Splendor**)
- The walls here are painted a very dark pink.
- A large tapestry hangs on the **West** wall. It depicts a great bonfire; bodies are burning within. Some are clearly human, but others look monstrous. A crowd of children is watching.
- **East** to the **Pool of Life**.
- **Southeast** to the **Engine Room**.

### 9. The Pool of Life (**Victory**)
- The walls here are painted a very light pink.
- Three small shifts pour water from the **Courtyard** into a large pool of fast-moving water in the center.
- Glinting within the waters is [treasure], next to a large wooden carving of a man, his feet rooted to the muddy ground.
- The water from the pool changes flesh to wood and earth.
-

### 10. The Engine Room (**Foundation**)
- **[Alukah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alukah)** is here, feeding off souls.

### 11. Throne Room (**Kingship**)
- The walls are painted a deep blue and black.
- Engravings of feet and mouths appear at intervals on the walls.
- On the **South** side a large chunk of earth has been removed, leaving a coffin-sized dip in the ground.

## Questions

### Multiple Entrances/Exits
- One entrance is beneath a rotating platform in the **Schul** (the pedestal)
- Another entrance via the **Orphan's Mound**

### Consider why it was built in the first place
- At the founding of the town, nearly 100 years before.
- Originally used as an underground tomb for the town's deceased; additionally a vault was built to house the town's wealth later expanded to deal with the great numbers of corpses resulting from the Dawn Plague thirty years before.
- Originally designed to keep townsfolk away from the hidden wealth; later to prevent Ghouls from raising the dead.

### Ideas
- Trap: an obvious painting on the ground/wall of whatever trap is behind it. Pressure tears the canvas, triggering the trap.
- False wells
- Head wires above tombs
- Powders that are inhaled
- Failed golems
- mercury addiction
