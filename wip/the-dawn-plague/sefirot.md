# Sefirot

## Details throughout:
- Letters and symbols are carved above nearly every doorway (translation in **Bold**), indicating the room's function and spiritual value.
- The smell of dried mud, decay and burnt-out candles.
- The walls of most rooms are made of earthen clay.

## Upper Level
### 1. Pedestal (**The Crown**)
- The stairs descend from the **Schul** a large hexagonal room. The walls are unpainted and marred with broken clay, as if purposefully left unshaped.
- A beautifully-wrought statue of a broken circle stands on a pedestal in the center of the room.
- The sculpture appears to face the viewer no matter where in the room they stand. A series of mirrors are positioned in each corner create the illusion; the object's true location is high up in the ceiling.  
- The **South** exit is blocked by a wall of brackish mud nearly 8 feet high. Halfway up there is a hole large enough to fit two arms through. The tunnel beyond appears dark. The lettering on top is smudged and broken.   
- To the **West** is an exit with no carvings above the doorway, but beyond the tunnel walls are lined with a swirling maelstrom of letters covering nearly every inch. It leads to the  to the **Inner Chamber**.
- **East** to the **Courtyard**, the smell of dead flowers; the sounds of rushing water.

### 2. Central Tunnel
-

### 3. Inner chamber (**Understanding**)
- The walls are painted a vibrant green; the room smells like smoke and sweat.
- A workshop crammed with desks and tools. Some of the tables are filled with miniature, half-built golems.
- It is difficult to move around without pushing the furniture around (and making a lot of noise in the process).
- A highly detailed human brain is skillfully etched onto the cavern wall. Below the diagram is a small bucket filled with grubby water and some drawing tools.
- Stairs on the **South** side go to the **Outer Chamber**
- On the **South-East** side is staircase going down to the **Lower Level** (see the **Treasury**).

### 4. Courtyard (**Wisdom**)
- The walls are painted blue. The pleasant sounds of bubbling water echo throughout the room.  
- In the center of the room is a bubbling fountain. In its middle stands a statue bearing both male and female components.
- In the fountain's basin are three large stones shaped into smooth ovals. They are in fact eggs left by the **Alukah**; they will hatch soon, then spread onto the surface.
- On the **South** wall is a water vein large enough for a person to crawl through, single-file. The shaft leads to ___ the **Pool of Life**. There are no markings around it.  
- In the **South-West** corner is staircase going down to the **Lower Level** (exiting into the **Treasury**).

#### 4a. Water Vein

- **[Alukah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alukah)** is here, feeding off souls.

### 11. Throne Room (**Kingship**)
- The Golem was given life here.

## Multiple Entrances/Exits
- One entrance is beneath a rotating platform in the **Schul** (the pedestal)
- Another entrance via the **Orphan's Mound**

## Consider why it was built in the first place
- At the founding of the town, nearly 100 years before.
- Originally used as an underground tomb for the town's deceased; additionally a vault was built to house the town's wealth later expanded to deal with the great numbers of corpses resulting from the Dawn Plague thirty years before.
- Originally designed to keep townsfolk away from the hidden wealth; later to prevent Ghouls from raising the dead.

## Levels
- **The Crown** (upper level), entrance from the **Schul**. Gradual descent from two different staircases
- Western staircase: the inner chamber (second level)
- Eastern Staircase: burial chamber (second level); has a vertical shaft leading from it and down into the outer chamber
- the outer chamber + tombs

## Have loops

## Have a lot of verticality

## Create secret areas/zones

## Variety in Room types

## Tactically useful areas

## Spying opportunities

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

## ideas:
- Trap: an obvious painting on the ground/wall of whatever trap is behind it. Pressure tears the canvas, triggering the trap.
- False wells
- Head wires above tombs
- Powders that are inhaled
- Failed golems
- mercury addiction
