# Wilderness Exploration

## The Basics
- A day is divided in 3 **phases** of 8 hours each (*morning*, *noon*, and *night*).
- A single **Wilderness Action** can be chosen per **phase**. 
- At the start of each day, roll on the [**Weather**](#weather) table for the appropriate season.
- **The Warden** determines the present [Difficulty](#difficulty) before each **phase** by noting the terrain, weather, and the party's relative status (maps, guides, injuries, exhaustion, etc).

## Sleep
- A character usually requires 6-8 hours of sleep. The last **phase** of the day is typically reserved for the [**Make Camp**](#make-camp) action. The characters could choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far more treacherous!
- If the party skips the [**Make Camp**](#make-camp) action, each PC adds one **Fatigue** to their inventory, and does not gain any benefits of sleep. They can only do this once before needing to rest fully. 

## Difficulty
### Terrain
- An area's terrain, weather, obstacles, and slow or injured party members can reduce travel speed. 
- Mounts, guides, maps can increase the party's travel speed or overcome a terrain's difficulty.
- Travelling at night _always_ increases the difficulty by one step (i.e. **Easy** terrain becomes **Tough**).

|              |                            |                 |                        |  
| ------------ | -------------------------- | --------------- | -----------------------|
| Difficulty   | Terrain                    | Speed           | Odds of Getting Lost   |
| **Easy**     | Roads, farmlands, plains   | Normal          | 1-in-6                 |
| **Tough**    | Jungles, forests, hills    | Half speed      | 2-in-6                 |
| **Perilous** | Swamps, deserts, mountains | One-third speed | 3-in-6                 |

### Inclement weather 
Results of a 5 or 6 on the [Weather Table](#weather)) can increase a terrain's difficulty by one step (e.g. **Easy** terrain becomes **Tough**).  

### Hex Crawls
- If using hexes, assume each tile is 6 miles across, and that the party can **Travel** to an adjacent tile in one **phase**.
- [**Getting Lost**](#getting-lost) places the party in an adjacent hex.

## Wilderness Actions
### Travel
- The party travels towards the chosen destination. A party walking on roads or settled terrain can travel up to 6 miles.
- Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance. 
- The current [**Difficulty**](#difficulty) affects how quickly the party travels, as well as how easily the party can lose their way (see [**Getting Lost**](#getting-lost)).
- Provided the party does not get lost, the **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).

#### Getting Lost
- If the party gets lost, they may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. 
- Maps and relevant backgrounds negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances of getting lost.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).

### Explore
The party searches for any hidden features within the current area.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- One Location or Feature is discovered.

### Supply
The party gathers food and water.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- Hunt, fish, or forage for food. Each person involved has a 3-in-6 chance of collecting 1d4 rations worth. Characters with relevant experience can increase the chances of success or negate the roll entirely. 

### **Make Camp**
The party stops to set up camp.
- Each party member (and their animals) consume a ration.
- A **Watch** rotation is set (typically 2 hours). If no rotation is possible, the character standing guard does not recover **Fatigue** and is _deprived_ until they can rest properly.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- Party members that were able to rest remove all of **Fatigue** from their inventory.

## Splitting Actions
If the characters split up, each party acts independently.

| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |

|  **2** | **Sign**  | The party discover a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area.   |
|  **3** | **Environment**  | A shift in weather or terrain.   |
|  **4** | **Loss**  | The party is faced with a choice that costs them a resource (rations, tools, etc), time, or effort. |

|  **6** | **Discovery** | The party find food, treasure, or other useful resources. The **Warden** can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area.  |

## Example

The party (3 healthy PCs walking by foot) are travelling from the village of **Rudbbat** to a ruin deep in the forest of **Ein Eyton**. 
- The party plots a path from their current location in the Southwest (which has roads and farmlands), over the **Deshe** hills, and into the forest. 
- The total journey is roughly 15 miles (6 miles on the road, 6 miles over the hills, and 3 miles into the forest). 
- The first day of travel, the **Warden** rolls a 3 on the **Weather** table (**Fall**: _Cool and foggy_). 

For their first **Phase**, the party decides to **Travel**, which takes them along a maintained road out of the village and through the farmlands. The terrain and weather indicate that the **Difficulty** level is **Easy**. The party is able to travel with no forseeable problems, so the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is an **Encounter**. The **Warden** explains that the party crosses paths with an NPC travelling South, who gives them a piece of advice: *avoid the hills, there are bandits about*! The party notes this and moves on, arriving in the **Deshe** hills after lunchtime. They rest near a streambed, stepping off the dusty road for the first time.

For the party's second **Phase**, the **Warden** explains that this area is peppered with small rocks and uneven hills, making it tougher to cross. Not only will the party travel at *half* their speed (3 miles per phase, arriving only a quarter of the way through by nightfall), but without a guide they might easily lose their way! The players discuss whether it would be better to spend a **Phase** exploring the area, finding a faster (and safer) way through. 

The party decides that the risk of crossing now and arriving at their destination sooner is worth it, and agree to proceed with the **Travel** action again. The players discuss how to avoid **Getting Lost**, checking to see if anyone in the party has knowledge of the area, relevant experience, or a map. They do not, so the **Warden** rolls 1d6. The result is not a **1** or a **2**, so regular **Travel** can finally begin. 

The **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table, and the result is **Environment**. The **Warden** explains that a short while after entering the hills, the ground becomes much more demanding to cross. Small rocks have become large crags, the hill turned to pits and mini-craters. The party now has a choice: push forward, spending a **Fatigue** to keep their speed, or slow down even further (1.5 miles per phase). They agree to push forward, each character adding a **Fatigue** to their inventory.

As night descends, the party finds a large, rocky, outcropping that would work as a suitable shelter. There is no water nearby, but this location should be sufficient for their current needs. They agree to **Make Camp** as their final **Phase**, choosing a **Watch Rotation** that should allow all party members a decent rest, and a chance to shed any **Fatigue** they have. Each party member consumes a ration, and the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is a **Sign**. The **Warden** describes the flickering ghost of a torchlight in the distance. Could it be another party, or perhaps bandits, or even a dangerous creature on the prowl?

The party rests, erasing their **Fatigue**. They have travelled only 9 of their 15 miles. If they push themselves tomorrow, they might arrive at the **Ein Eyton** ruins by nightfall.
