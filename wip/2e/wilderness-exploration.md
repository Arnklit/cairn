# Wilderness Exploration

## Hex Crawling
- A "hex" represents 6 miles on a map. 
- A healthy person can travel by foot up to two hexes per day. Horses and similar mounts double travelling speed.
- A day is divided in 3 phases of 8 hours each (morning, noon, night).
- A single **Wilderness Action** can be chosen per phase. 
- For each night the party skips the **Rest** action, each PC adds one **Fatigue** to their inventory.
- At the start of each day, roll on the [**Weather**](#weather) table for the appropriate season.

### Wilderness Actions
#### Travel
- The partytTravels across a single hex. Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby hexes are revealed according to their distance.
- The party must be careful to avoid losing their way (see the [Getting Lost](#getting-lost) table).
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).

##### Getting Lost
- There is a 2-in-6 chance the party will get lost when traveling via difficult or hard-to-see terrain.
- If the party gets lost, roll 1d4 for cardinal directions (1 = N, 2 = W, 3 = S, 4 = E). The party arrives in an adjacent hex in that direction, and must spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way.
- Maps and relevant backgrounds negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances to 1-in-6.

#### Explore
The party searches for hidden any features within the current hex.
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- One Location/Feature is discovered.

#### Supply
The party gathers food and water.
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- Hunt, fish, or forage for food. Each person involved has a 3-in-6 chance of collecting 1d4 rations worth. Characters with relevant experience can increase the chances of success or negate the roll entirely. 

#### Rest
The party stops to set up camp.
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- If the party is able to rest fully, each party members loses all their **Fatigue** (if applicable).

## Events Table 
The GM rolls a **d6** and consults the table appropriate to the party’s location.

|                         |                  |             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
|  **1** |  **Encounter** | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for NPC [Miens](#npc-miens) if applicable. |
|  **2** | **Sign**  | The characters discover a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby hex.   |
|  **3** | **Locality**  | A shift in weather, terrain.   |
|  **4** | **Expiration**  | Resources are drained in some way (lost ration or broken tools).   |
|  **5** | **Exhaustion** |  The characters encounter a barrier, forcing either careful effort (spend an additional **Wilderness Action**) or each character adds a **Fatigue** to their inventory to represent the relative difficulty of the task.
|  **6** | **Discovery** | The characters find food, treasure, or other useful resources. The Warden can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the hex.  |

## NPC Miens
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table.

| 2 | 3-5 | 6-8 | 9-11 | 12 |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Friendly | Helpful
