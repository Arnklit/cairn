# Wilderness Exploration

## Hex Crawling
- A "hex" represents 6 miles on a map. 
- A day is divided into 3 phases of approximately 8 hours each. 
- A single **Wilderness Action** can be chosen per phase. In order to avoid **Fatigue** or _depriviation_, one phase is usually spent taking the **Rest** action. 

### Wilderness Actions
#### Travel
The party travels through a hex. 
- If travelling by road, an unencumbered and otherwise healthy person person can walk 24 miles per day, or 48 miles by horse.
- Obvious locations, features, and terrain types of nearby hexes are revealed according to their distance.
- The party must be careful to avoid [Getting Lost](#getting-lost).
- Roll on the [Events Table](#events-table).

##### Getting Lost
- There is typically a 2-in-6 chance the party will get lost when traveling via difficult or hard-to-see terrain.
- Maps and relevant backgrounds negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances to 1-in-6.

#### Explore
The party searches for hidden any features within the current hex.
- Roll on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- One Location/Feature is discovered.

#### Supply
The party gathers food and water.
- Roll on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- Depending on event, the party gathers 1d4 rations per person searching. 

#### Rest
The party stops to set up camp.
- Roll on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- If the party is able to rest fully, each party members loses all their **Fatigue** (if applicable).

#### Fatigue
For each night the party skips the **Rest** action, each PC adds one **Fatigue** to their inventory.
