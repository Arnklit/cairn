# Wilderness Exploration

## The Basics
- The day is divided in 3 **phases** of 8 hours each: _morning_, _noon_, and _night_.
- The party can choose _one_ [**Wilderness Action**](#wilderness-actions) per **phase**. 
- A typical region will have a set number of _known_ locations, called **points**. 
- One or more **phases** may be required to journey between two **points** on a map, depending on the party's **travel speed**.
- A party walking on roads or settled terrain can usually travel between two nearby **points** in a single **phase**. 
- Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party's travel speed or overcome a terrain's [**Difficulty**](#difficulty). 

### Hex Maps
- If using hexes, assume that the **Travel** action moves the party to an adjacent tile in one **phase** at _Normal_ **travel speed**, and that if they get lost they end up in an adjacent hex.

## Day Cycle
- Each _morning_, the **Warden** rolls on the [**Weather**](#weather) table for the appropriate season.
- Before each **phase** begins, the party plots or adjusts a given course towards their destination based on available information.
- The **Warden** explains how the current [**Difficulty**](#difficulty) affects the party's **travel speed**, what obstacles the party may face, and the odds of [**Getting Lost**](#getting-lost). The party adjusts their plans accordingly.
- The party chooses a single **Wilderness Action**, and the **Warden** narrates the results. 
- Repeat the process for the other two **phases**. The last **phase** of the day is typically reserved for the [**Make Camp**](#make-camp) action (see [**Sleep**](#sleep) below).

### Sleep
- Characters typically need to sleep each day. Anything beyond a minor interruption can negate or cancel the benefits of sleep.
- If the party skips the **Make Camp** action, they each add one **Fatigue** to their inventory, and are _deprived_.
- Party members can skip sleeping _once_ before needing to rest fully again the next day.
- The party can choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far slower and more treacherous!

## Difficulty
- An area's terrain, weather, obstacles, and slow or injured party members can reduce travel speed. 
- Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party's travel speed or overcome a terrain's difficulty.
- Inclement weather (such as results of a 5 or 6 on the [Weather Table](#weather)) can increase a terrain's difficulty or make travel impossible.
- Travelling at night _always_ increases the difficulty by one step (i.e. **Easy** terrain becomes **Tough**).
- The party may need to spend **Fatigue**, time, a tool, or other resource in order to overcome an obstacle or difficulty.

### Terrain

|                  |                            |                     |                          |  
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------|
| **Difficulty**   | **Terrain**                | **Travel Duration** | **Odds of Getting Lost** |
| **Easy**         | Roads, farmlands, plains   | _Normal_            | None                     |
| **Tough**        | Jungles, forests, hills    | _Doubled_           | 2-in-6                   |
| **Perilous**     | Swamps, deserts, mountains | _Tripled_           | 3-in-6                   |

## Wilderness Actions
### Travel
- Travel begins. Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance. 
- If necessary, the party rolls 1d6 to see if they've become lost.
- Provided the party does not get lost, the **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).

#### Getting Lost
- If the party gets lost, they may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. 
- Maps and relevant backgrounds may negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances of getting lost.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).

### Explore
- The party covers a large area, searching for hidden features, scouting ahead, or treading carefully.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- One Location or Feature is discovered.
- The **Travel** action is still required to _leave_ the current area, even if it has been completely explored.

### Supply
- The party gathers food and water.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- Hunt, fish, or forage for food. Each person involved has a 3-in-6 chance of collecting 1d4 rations worth. Characters with relevant experience can increase the chances of success or negate the roll entirely. 

### **Make Camp**
- The party stops to set up camp. Each party member (and their mounts) consume a ration.
- A **Watch** rotation is set from each party member. If a rotation is not possible, whomever stands guard gains a **Fatigue** and is _deprived_ until they are able to rest properly.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- Party members that were able to rest remove all of **Fatigue** from their inventory.

## Splitting Up
- If the characters split up, each party is treated as independent entities, and rolls impact only the group triggering the action..

## Example
In this example we'll be using a map made with [Watabou's](https://watabou.itch.io/) terrific [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) generator.

[![Alt text](/img/2e/wilderness-map.png "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/wilderness-map.png)

The party (3 healthy PCs walking by foot) are plotting a journey to an ancient ruin deep in the forests of **Ein Eyton**. 
The forest (at **3**) is separated from the party's present location (the village of **Rudbat**, at **1**) by the neighboring **Range of Deshe** (at **2**), a short distance away. 

The **Warden** explains that travelling on the forgiving roads from the village to the hills will require only a single **phase**, but that it will take three _additional_ **phases** for the party to complete their journey to the forest, assuming they spend one **phase** sleeping. 

The party accepts this route, plotting their route: one **phase** to reach the hills (_morning_), one **phase** partway through the hills (_afternoon_), then another **phase** sleeping (the **Making Camp** action) at (_night_). The party would spend the following day's _morning_ **phase** travelling to their final destination. On the first day of travel, the **Warden** rolls a 3 on the **Weather** table (**Fall**: _Cool and foggy_). 

For their first **phase**, the party chooses the **Travel** action, taking the road through the farmlands and to the hills. The terrain, weather, and current party status indicates that the **Difficulty** level is **Easy**. The party is able to travel with no forseeable problems, so the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is an **Encounter**. The **Warden** explains that the party crosses paths with an NPC travelling South, who gives them a piece of advice: "_Avoid the hills, there are bandits about_!" The party notes this and moves on, arriving in the **Range of Deshe** after lunchtime. They rest near a streambed, stepping off the dusty road for the first time.

For the party's second **phase**, the **Warden** explains that this area is peppered with small rocks and uneven hills, setting the terrain **Difficulty** to **Tough**. Worse yet, without a guide the party might easily lose their way! The players discuss whether it would be better to spend a **Phase** exploring the area, perhaps even finding a faster (and safer) way through. 

The party agrees that arriving at their destination sooner is worth the risk, and proceeds with the **Travel** action again. The players discuss how to avoid **Getting Lost**, checking to see if anyone in the party has knowledge of the area, relevant experience, or a map. They do not, so the **Warden** rolls 1d6. The result is not a **1** or a **2**, and the party moves on as planned.

The **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table, and the result is **Environment**. The **Warden** explains that a short while after entering the hills, the ground became much more demanding to cross. Small rocks turned into large crags, the hills to pits and mini-craters. The party now has a choice: push forward, spending a **Fatigue** to keep their current speed, or slow down, adding an additional **phase** of travel to their journey. They agree to push forward, each character adding a **Fatigue** to their inventory. Had they chosen to walk slower it may have been safer, but they would have an additional half-day of walking to do tomorrow.

As night descends, the party finds a large, rocky, outcropping that would work as a suitable shelter. There is no water nearby, but this location should be sufficient for their current needs. They agree to **Make Camp** as their final **phase**, choosing a **Watch Rotation** that should allow all party members a decent rest, and a chance to shed any **Fatigue** they have. Each party member consumes a ration, and the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is a **Sign**. The **Warden** describes the flickering ghost of a torchlight in the distance. Could it be another party, or perhaps bandits, or even a dangerous creature on the prowl?

The party rests, erasing their **Fatigue**. They mark their current location on the map, noting that should everything go well the following day, they should only have to spend one **phase** to arrive at the ruins of **Ein Eyton** by the early afternoon.
