# Character Creation

## Name, Background & Traits

- First roll on the [Backgrounds](#backgrounds) table. A PCâ€™s background informs their potential knowledge and skills. You'll need to refer to the Background result for the next few steps.
- Choose a name from the available list, then roll on each included table for the Background. Record the items, skills, or abilities gained (or lost) from each result.    
- Next, roll for the rest of your character's **traits** (appearance, speech, mannerisms, beliefs, reputation, etc.) on the [**Character Traits**](#character-traits-d10) tables. 
- Finally, roll for your character's **age** (2d20+10).

## Ability Scores  

- Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes: **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**.
- Roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.
- Ability scores are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily weak; they can still attempt to raise a door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher. 

## Hit Protection  

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd#scars-1) table.

### Inventory

- Characters have a total of ten inventory slots, but can only carry four items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Each PC starts with a **backpack** that can hold up to six slots. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment. 
- Inventory is _abstract_, dependent only on the fiction, adjudicated by the Warden. When ten slots are filled, the character becomes _deprived. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

#### Item Size

Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated. 

- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. These items are rarely useful mechanically. 
- _Bulky_ items take up two slots. Armor, two-handed weapons, treasure, and some Relics.
- At the **Warden's** discretion, some smaller items (e.g. a deck of cards, dice) can be _bundled_ with one or more additional items, occupying only one slot.

### Currency

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). 
- A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and takes no slots.
- Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.
- Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.
