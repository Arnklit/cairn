# Factions Overview
- Rules for initially generating **Factions** for your setting can be found [here](/wip/2e/setting#factions).
- **Factions** possess **Advantages** that allow them to accomplish their goals, the culmination of which will result in fulfilling their **Agendas**.
- All Factions also face **Obstacles**, which prevent them from easily accomplishing their **Agendas**
- A **Faction** may be governed by a one or more powerful figures, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with subordinates known as **Seneschals**.
- **Factions** will work to complete their **Agendas** independently, enlisting the help of PCs only when advantageous.

> The setting map should reflect the impact of **Factions** as they work on completing their **Agendas** and acquiring more **Advantages**.



## Advantages & Agendas
- **Advantages** reflect a **Faction's** influence, materials, wealth, and unique features. **Advantages** are best interpreted through the lens of **Faction Type**.
- **Factions** add or lose **Advantages** by trying to complete their **Agenda**.
- **Factions** leverage **Advantages** as much as possible to achieve their goals, and at the same time work to acquire _more_ **Advantages**. 
- **Agendas** are accomplished through the completion of **goals** that work toward a clear objective or purpose. They are rooted in desire: that for power, wealth, revenge, resources, etc.

> If a Faction completes an **Agenda**, either roll another one or choose the option from the table that is best supported by developments in the fiction.

## Obstacles
- All **Agendas** have at least one **Obstacle** that stands in the way of their completion.  
- Additional **Obstacles** can arise through **Faction Actions** (see below) or through developments in the fiction.

### Goals
  - Goals are _progressive_, each building on the previous successes (or failures) of earlier goals.
  - Most goals should focus on acquiring a distinct **Advantage** in order to proceed to the next goal.
  - At least one goal should deal with the **Faction's** primary **Obstacle** (see above). This may be the first goal, or the last.

## Seneschals
- **Seneschals** are often in charge of completing one or more of the goals of the **Agenda** of a **Faction**.
- Particularly large **Factions** may have additional **Seneschals**, often with each in charge of a different set of **Resources**
- Small **Factions** may have a single leader that acts as **Seneschal**, and may even be a **Faction** of one!

> Often **Seneschals** will have personal motivations that differ from the Faction's main **Agenda**, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain.

## Faction Rules
- By default, **Factions** operate independent of the player character's actions. If the PCs do nothing, the **Factions** should still act to achieve their aims.
- Whenever a **Faction** is positioned to advance a **goal** in their **Agenda**, roll a **d12** on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table. 
- If two **Factions** are _opposed_, the **Faction** _most at risk_ makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking **Seneschal**. 
  - On a success, the **Faction** most at risk rolls on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, and their opponent does not.
  - On a fail, the **Faction** most at risk _does not_ roll on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, but their opponent does.

> The **Warden** should rely on the fiction to determine whether a **Faction** is positioned to advance their **Agenda**. **Goals** may be time-sensitive or depend on explicit circumstances. Other times it might be more appropriate after a major event, alliance, or friction between one or more **Factions**, etc.

| **d12**   | **Consequence**   | **Impact**                                                     |
| **1-2**   | **Failure**       | A new **Obstacle** is introduced, and a **Advantage** is lost. |
| **3-4**   | **Setback**       | An **Advantage** is lost.                                       |
| **5-6**   | **Status Quo**    | Nothing is gained, but nothing is lost.                        |
| **7-8**   | **Mixed Success** | A **goal** is achieved,  but an **Advantage** is lost.          |
| **9-10**  | **Success**       | A **goal** is achieved, and no **Advantages** are lost.        |
| **11-12** | **Major Success** | A **goal** is achieved, and a new **Advantage** is found.      |

> The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a **Faction** action, or in some cases shift the outcome of the roll in a favorable or unfavorable direction.
