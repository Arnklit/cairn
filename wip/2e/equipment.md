# Equipment

## Size

Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated. 
- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. These items are rarely useful mechanically. Any currency under 100gp is _petty_.
- _Bulky_ items take up two slots. Armor, two-handed weapons, treasure, and some Relics.
- At the **Warden's** discretion, some smaller items (e.g. a deck of cards, dice) can be _bundled_ with one or more additional items, occupying only one slot.

### Example

The following PC has used 7 of 10 available slots. The Chalk and Net are bundled together in one slot.

- 62gp
- Rations (3 uses)
- Lantern (_bulky_, 6 uses)
- Oil can
- Sword (d6)
- Gambeson (+1 Armor)
- Chalk + Net 
- Scarf (_petty_)
