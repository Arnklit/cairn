# Setting

### Summary
- A setting has a **Theme**, **Scale**, **Factions**, **Terrain**, and **Details**.
- A **Province** is a single, traversable region within a setting. A **Domain** is one or more joined **Provinces**.
- Distance is measured in [**Watches**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot and on maintained roads.

> See [this page](/wip/2e/example-setting) for an example setting.

## Theme
Established facts about the setting. Good questions to answer: 
- How is magic in this world?
- What level of technology is it?
- How does religion function?
- Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their relative position with respect to those in power?
- What races & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
- What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting?

### Scale
- **Small**: A single **Province** whose central hub is typically a large village, no more than _four_ **Watches** from the furthest settled **Detail**.  
- **Medium**: 2-4 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large town), no more than _eight_ **Watches** from the furthest settled **Detail**.
- **Large**: 5-10 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large city), no more than _sixteen_ **Watches** from the furthest settled **Detail**.

## Factions
- Factions rule over one or more **Details**, an entire **Province**, or even a **Domain**. 
- The map should reflect the impact of goals being completed or interrupted. **Factions** will work to achieve their goals independently.
- Each **faction** is ruled by a powerful figure, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with their **Seneschals**. 

### Agendas & Resources
- Factions have **Agendas** (3-4 steps towards a clear goal) and the **Resources** to help achieve them. 
- A faction's **Resources** reflect its influence, resources, wealth, and special features. 
- Factions grow (or lose) their **Resources** by trying to complete their agenda. 

## Provinces

### Creating a Province
1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a dot to signify the central hub (a village, town, or city) of the **Province**. Number it **1**. 
2. Create three more dots in a triangle with the central hub in the rough center. Each of these dots represents an additional **Detail** on the map. Number these as well, in the order you create them.
3. Connect two of the dots to the central hub, using solid lines to represent roads, dotted lines for trails, and double lines for rivers and tunnels. Connect the remaining dot to one of these paths, crossing it and continuing for a distance. 
4. Repeat step #2, orienting the triangle of dots in a different way than before. Number each dot.
5. Connect two of the new dots to _any_ path, numbering each as you go. Do not connect the final dot.
6. Create a new dot wherever paths cross, and wherever a new path ends. Number them as you go.

> You can use other shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, etc) to create dots instead. Try varying the distance between dots for each successive **Province**. You can repeat this process for any adjacent **Provinces**, connecting them by road, river, or range.  


### Adding Terrain
1. Roll on the [Hub Terrain](#hub-terrain) table to determine the central hub's terrain. Choose **one** terrain from the results. 
2. Roll on the [Near Terrain](#near-terrain) table to determine the terrain for any dots within _two_ hops of the central hub. Choose **one** terrain from the results for each.
3. Roll on the [Far Terrain](#far-terrain) for any dots that are _three_ or more hops from the central hub, as well as those not connected to any path. Choose **one** terrain from the results for each.
4. Drawn or indicate the terrain for each dot on the map.

## Details
- Each dot on the map is one **Detail**. **Details** act as [**Points**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) according to the [**Wilderness Exploration**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration) rules.
- Locations in a **Province** are divided into three categories: **The Wilds**, **The Settled Lands**, and **The Underworld**.
- Keep in mind how many **Watches** it might take to travel to each **Detail**. 

> Look at the factions you wrote earlier. For each, consider which **Details** could be designated as a "home base." Also, consider where their **Seneschals** and minions might be.

### Adding Details
1. Generate features about the central hub of the **Province** (a village, town, or city) by rolling on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table.
2. Generate features for each remaining dot by first rolling on the the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table.
3. For any settlements rolled, roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table as well.

### Detail Names
#### On names
- Settlements are named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. Then, the residents add a noun or adjective. _Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Pitty Gardens.
- Wilderness and dangerous places are even more obvious: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path, etc. 
- Important places should have important names: that of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events. _The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine_, etc.

1. Roll on the Place Name Template table.
2. Roll on the Place, Adjective and Noun tables.
