# Setting

### Summary
- A setting has a **Theme**, **Scale**, **Factions**, **Details**, and **Terrain**.
- A **Province** is a single, traversable region within a setting. A **Domain** is one or more joined **Provinces**.
- Distance is measured in [**Watches**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot and on maintained roads.

> See [this page](/wip/2e/example-setting) for an example setting.

## Theme
Established facts about the setting. Good questions to answer: 
- How is magic in this world?
- What level of technology is it?
- How does religion function?
- Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their relative position with respect to those in power?
- What races & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
- What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting?

### Scale
- **Small**: A single **Province** whose central hub is typically a large village, no more than _eight_ **Watches** from the furthest settled **Detail**.  
- **Medium**: 2-4 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large town), no more than _sixteen_ **Watches** from the furthest settled **Detail**.
- **Large**: 5-10 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large city), no more than _twenty-four_ **Watches** from the furthest settled **Detail**.

## Factions
- Factions rule over one or more **Details**, an entire **Province**, or even a **Domain**. 
- The **Domain** map should reflect the impact of goals being completed or interrupted. Factions will work to achieve their goals independently.
- Each faction is ruled by a powerful figure, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with their **Seneschals**. 

### Agendas & Resources
- Factions have **Agendas** (3-4 steps towards a clear goal) and the **Resources** to help achieve them. 
- A faction's **Resources** reflect its influence, resources, wealth, and special features. 
- Factions grow (or lose) their **Resources** by trying to complete their agenda. 

## Details
- **Details** act as [**Points**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) according to the [**Wilderness Exploration**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration) rules.
- Most **Details** are placed in the **Wilds** or the **Settled Lands**.  
- **Underworld** **Details** is typically hidden or underground, and can be anywhere or everywhere.

### Creating a Province
1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a **point** to signify the central hub (a village, town, or city) of the **Province**.
2. Create three more **points** in a triangle with the central hub in the rough center. Each of these points represents an additional **Detail** on the map. 
3. Connect two of the **points** to the central hub, using solid lines to represent roads, dotted lines for trails, and double lines for rivers and tunnels. Connect the remaining **point** to one of these paths, crossing it and continuing for a distance. 
4. Repeat step #2. 
5. Connect two of the new **points** to _any_ path. Do not connect the final **point** to anything. 
6. Create a new **point** wherever paths cross, and wherever a path ends that does not already have a **point**. 
7. Number each **point** on the map.
