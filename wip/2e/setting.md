# Setting

### Summary
- A setting has a **Theme**, **Terrain**, **Details**, and **Factions**. 
- See [this page](/wip/2e/example-setting) for an example setting.
- Distance is measured in [**Watches**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot and on maintained roads.

## Theme
Established facts about the setting. Good questions to answer: 
- How does magic work?
- What level of technology do the denizens have?
- How does religion function? Do gods walk the lands, and do the people know it?
- Who are the PCs in the setting? What is theirposition with respect to those in power?
- What species & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
- What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting? 

## Provinces
- A **Province** is a single, traversable landscape roughly defined by divisble terrain (mountain ranges, rivers, oceans). 
- A **Domain** is one or more adjacent **Provinces** defined by the same ruler(s). 
- Each **Province** has a **Heart**: a settlement (of any size) that reflects the history, **Factions**, and peoples of the land.

### Scale
- **Small Province**: A **Heart** no more than _four_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.  
- **Medium Province**: A **Heart** no more than _eight_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.
- **Large Province**: A **Heart** no more than _sixteen_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.

### Creating a Province
1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a dot to signify the **Heart** of the **Province**. 
2. Create three more dots in a triangle with the **Heart** in the rough center. Each of these dots represents an additional **Detail** on the map. 
3. Connect two of the dots to the **Heart**, using solid lines to represent roads, dotted lines for trails, double solid lines for rivers, and double dotted lines for tunnels. 
4. Connect the remaining dot to one of these paths, crossing it and continuing for a distance. 
5. Repeat step #2, orienting the triangle of dots in a different way than before. 
6. Connect two of the new dots to _any_ path, but do not connect the final dot to anything! This is the **Frontier**.
7. Create a new dot wherever paths cross, and wherever a new path ends. 
8. Number the dots, starting from the **Heart** and expanding outwards. The **Heart** is always **1**, and the **Frontier** is always the terminal number.

#### Tips
- You can increease the **Province Scale** by doubling the triangle in step **5**, then adding dots halfway between two points on any line (roads, trails, rivers, etc).
- You can use other shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, etc) to create dots instead. You can even mix & match!
- You can repeat this process for any adjacent **Provinces**, connecting them by road, river, or range. 

### Adding Terrain
1. Roll on the [Terrain Table](#terrain-table) below for each numbered dot, starting with the **Heart**. 
2. Terrain modifiers are based on the [Terrain Difficulty](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#terrain-difficulty) rules. **E** = Easy, **T** = Tough, **P** = Perilous.
3. Drawn or indicate the terrain for each dot on the map.

| **d12** |                                                                                                                    |
| **1**   | The clouds are shaped like faces. They appear to be laughing.                                                      |
| **2**   | Roaming, coughing, dust clouds that smell of cinnamon.                                                             |
| **3**   | Days are erratic. The Sun goes backwards for a time, then jumps forward rapidly as night quickly falls.            |
| **4**   | Lakes and streams dry up in minutes, filling storm clouds that drench the landscape.                               |
| **5**   | Rainbows lack most of their colors, and occasionally flicker. Raindrops fall in various colors. Do not taste them. |
| **6**   | Distant chimes instead of thunder. A smokey, sweet wind stems from the **West**, with no apparent origin.          |
| **7**   | Fog there fills the belly (no need for rations). Tomorrow, vomiting.                                               |
| **8**   | The winds carry whispers; some sawy with hints of the future.                                                      |
| **9**   | Shadows disappear at random. Animals do not want to go there.                                                      |
| **10**  | Flashes of movement in the periphery. They always amount to nothing. Travelers return without their memories.      |
| **11**  | The air is thicker than usual, and breathing is difficult. Drinking water seems to help.                           |
| **12**  | Rains of small aquatic creatures (tadpoles, frogs, small fish). No one seems to knows where they come from.        |

## Details
- Each dot on the map is one **Detail**. **Details** act as [**Points**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) according to the [**Wilderness Exploration**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration) rules. Keep in mind how many **Watches** it might take to travel to each **Detail**. 
- The **Heart** of a **Province** is always a settlement. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place people live, but it does always have a significant history. 
- Assume there are small villages scattered around larger settlements. These do not need to be represented by dots or **Details**!   

### Adding Details
1. Roll on the [Settlements](#settlements) and [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) tables to generate the **Heart** of the **Province**.
2. Generate features for each remaining dot _except_ the **Frontier** by first rolling on the the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table.
3. For any additional Settlements rolled, roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table as well.
4. Generate features for the **Frontier** by rolling _only_ the [Special](#special) table.

> If some of the results below seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn it into a question: _Why_ is there **hazardous** terrain so close to a settlement? Perhaps there were mines there once, long abandoned. Rumors as to their true treasure - and dangers - abound! That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

### Detail Names
- Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. The residents then add a noun or adjective: _Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Pitty Gardens_, etc.
- Important places (like cities) should have important names, like those of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events: _The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine_, etc.
- Wild and dangerous places are named after their obvious hazards: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: _Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path_, etc. 

#### Generating Names
- Starting with the **Heart**, roll on the [Name Formulas](#name-formulas) table to name each **Detail** on the map. 
- [**Nouns**] can be added to or even replace [**Adjectives**] on the table, e.g. **Bruna's Ugly Gulch**.
- Use the [Terrain Synonyms](#terrain-synonyms) table for inspiration. Refer to the [Example Names](#example-names) for a model of each table result.

## Factions
- Factions rule over one or more **Details**, an entire **Province**, or even a **Domain**. 
- The map should reflect the impact of goals being completed or interrupted. **Factions** will work to complete their **Agenda** independently.
- A **Faction** may be governed by a powerful figure, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with their lieutenants, or **Seneschals**. 

### Agendas & Resources
- **Factions** have **Agendas** (3-4 **goals** towards a clear objective) and the **Resources** to help achieve them. 
- **Resources** reflect a **Factions'** influence, materials, wealth, and special features. 
- **Factions** grow (or lose) their **Resources** by trying to complete their agenda. 

### Creating Factions
- Consider the **Details** and **Terrain** you've developed. Note what is worth protecting, as well as what is worth taking.
- **Agendas** are lofty plans with distinct steps based on actionable goals. They should relate to the acquisition of powerful territory, weapons, money, and **Resources**. 
- Do not feel limited by the table results below. If something feels "off" or a different table result would work better for your setting, use it!

#### Factions Creation Procedure
- First, follow steps **1-5** for every Settlement **Detail** on the map, starting with the **Heart**.
- Then, select either a Lair or Ruin on the map. Follow steps 1-5 to make at least one **Faction** for that site. 
- Repeat as desired.
1. Roll on the [Faction Types](#faction-types) table to determine the nature of the Faction. 
2. Consider how many Resources a Faction of this type might have (between 2-4) and roll accordingly on the [Faction Resources](#faction-resources) table. Flesh out the specifics of the Resources as indicated by the results from the table. 
3. Roll on the the [**Faction Agendas**](#faction-agendas) table and consider what their specific **Agenda** may be given your current information. Establish a series of goals (3-4) that must be accomplished for this **Agenda** to be accomplished.
4. Roll on the [Faction Obstacles](#faction-obstacles) table. Use the result to consider what might prevent the **Agenda** from succeeding.
5. Create at least one **Seneschal**, inspired by the **Faction** type, **Resources**, and **Agenda**, and **Obstacle**. Think of where they might be located on the map. Make that location the **Faction's** home base.

| **1**   | **Academic**      | An upstart cartographer's guild, preparing to map the **Far Reaches**. Many have tried, but none have returned.          |
| **2**   | **Arcane**        | A league of wizards in search of an ancient power. They can't entrust its discovery to less experence hands.             |
| **3**   | **Cabal**         | A secret society, its machinations shrouded in mystery. But its goal is all too clear: a new world order.                |
| **4**   | **Commoners**     | Together, they are strong. Together they can move mountains. But who do they really serve?                               |
| **5**   | **Criminal**      | An uneasy alliance of ruffians, thieves, and killers.  Their boss is scariesst of them all.                              |
| **6**   | **Government**    | Politicians, bureaucrats, tax collectors: they are everywhere. Who are they helping, besides themselves?                 |
| **7**   | **Industrial**    | Workers, united by a charismatic and troubled leader. Fighting for a better life.                                        |
| **8**   | **Mercantile**    | A cartel of beaming merchants, vendors, and trade experts. Followers of none, save for the almighty coin.                |
| **9**   | **Military**      | Disgraced officers, relying on their only remaining assets: a soldier's loyalty. It might be enough.                     |
| **10**  | **Noble**         | A family built on deft politicking. Their house is in debt to a dangerous group, and they could lose everything.         |
| **11**  | **Religious**     | Stewards of sacred artifacts, guided by the divine to reclaim their most holy of objects.                                |

### Faction Rules
- By default, **Factions** operate independent of the player character's actions. If the PCs do nothing, the **Factions** should still act to achieve their aims.
- Whenever a **Faction** is positioned to advance a goal in their **Agenda**, roll a **d12** on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table. 
- If two **Factions** are _opposed_, the **Faction** _most at risk_ makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking **Seneschal**. 
  - On a success, the **Faction** most at risk rolls on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, and their opponent does not.
  - On a fail, the **Faction** most at risk _does not_ roll on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, but their opponent does.

| **1-2**   | **Failure**       | A new **Obstacle** is introduced, and a **Resource** is lost. |
| **3-4**   | **Setback**       | A **Resource** is lost.                                       |
| **5-6**   | **Status Quo**    | Nothing is gained, but nothing is lost.                       |
| **7-8**   | **Mixed Success** | A **goal** is achieved,  but a **Resource** is lost.          |
| **9-10**  | **Success**       | A **goal** is achieved, and no **Resources** are lost.        |
| **11-12** | **Major Success** | A **goal** is achieved, and a new **Resource** is found.      |

> The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a **Faction** action, or in some cases provide an advantage of some kind to the roll. 

## Name The Province
Consider the following when determining the **Province** name:
- What are the key geographic features of the region? 
- What major events (war, famine, discoveries) occured here in the past? Who were the major players?
- What sort of factions have historically dominated this place?
- A name may also include a reference to the region's relative position to the seat of power: _The Northeast Redoubt_, _Western Ranges_, etc.
- The name (first, or family) of a "discoverer", conquerer or colonizer often sticks around long after their death.

## Conclusion
Congratulations, your **Province** is complete! You can now "drill down" into various locations (starting with the **Heart**) and build out each **Detail** on your own favorite tables. Keep the following thoughts in mind as you go:
- How might the interactions between the **Factions** interact with the landscape, its features, and one another? How will this change as the **Factions** succeed (or fail) at their goals? 
Consider which **Factions** may be allied, and which opposed? Keep in mind the region's history, what a **Faction** might have that others would want, and what someone would do to _get_ them. 
- Consider the history of the region's original "discoverers", the locals they may have supplanted, and where both groups are today. 
- When building out the next **Province**, keep in mind how it would have interacted historically with this **Province**, and what might happen between them in the future.

> If you find anything _amiss_ or **wrong** feel free to change it, or add your own **Details**. Remember, it's _your_ setting.
