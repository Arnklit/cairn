# Setting

### Summary
- Settings have a **Theme**, **Scale**, **Terrain,** and **Details**. 
- Distance is measured in [**Watches**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#watches).
- In general, play takes place in either the **Wilds** or the **Provinces**. 
- The **Underworld** is typically hidden or underground, and can be placed anywhere.

## Theme
Established facts about the setting. Some questions to ask: 
- How is magic in this world?
- What level of technology is it?
- How does religion function?
- Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their relative position with respect to those in power?
- What races & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
- What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting?

### Example Theme
- Low-magic (magic is known but rarely understood)
- Technology is 13th or 14th century (gunpowder, longbows, some agricultural innovations, pre-printing press)
- Religion exists, but is murky and unprovable. Deities do not necessarily walk the lands, though some believe they do.
- PCs are Human-only, and are neutral towards the centers of power.
- Names & proper nouns are largely plain English. Themes are inspired by the British Isles and Eastern Europe.

### Province Scale
- Small: A single **Province** centered around a large town, with **details** no more than 3 standard **Watches** away.
- Medium: 2-4 **Provinces** centered around a medium-sized town or small city, with **details** no more than 6 standard **Watches** away. 
- Large: 5-10 **Provinces** centered around a large city, with **details** no more than 12 standard **Watches** away. 

## Details
- **Details** act as [**Points**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) for the purposes of [**Wilderness Exploration**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration).
