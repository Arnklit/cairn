# Setting

### Summary
- Settings have a **Theme**, **Scale**, **Factions**, **Terrain,** and **Details**. 
- Distance is measured in [**Travel Watches**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot and on maintained roads.
- In general, the adventure takes place in either the **Wilds** or in one of the **Settled Lands**. 
- The **Underworld** is typically hidden or underground, and can be placed anywhere.

## Theme
Established facts about the setting. Some questions to ask: 
- How is magic in this world?
- What level of technology is it?
- How does religion function?
- Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their relative position with respect to those in power?
- What races & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
- What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting?

### Setting Scale
#### Small
- A single **Province** whose central hub is a large village. 
- The distance between a settled **Detail** and the central hub is no more than _eight_ **Travel Watches** away.  

#### Medium
- 2-4 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large town).
- The distance between a settled **Detail** and the central hub is no more than _sixteen_ **Travel Watches** away. 

#### Large
- 5-10 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large city). 
- The distance between a settled **Detail** and the central hub is no more than _twenty-four_ **Travel Watches** away. 

## Details
- **Details** act as [**Points**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) for the purposes of [**Wilderness Exploration**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration).

## Example Setting

### Example Theme
- Low-magic (magic is known but rarely understood).
- Technology is 13th or 14th century (gunpowder, longbows, some agricultural innovations, pre-printing press).
- Religion exists, but is murky and unprovable. Deities do not necessarily walk the lands, though some believe they do.
- PCs are Human-only, and are neutral towards the centers of power.
- Names & proper nouns are largely plain English. Themes are inspired by the British Isles, Germany, and Eastern Europe.
