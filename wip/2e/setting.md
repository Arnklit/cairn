# Setting

### Summary
- A setting has a **Theme**, **Scale**, **Terrain**, **Details**, and **Factions**. 
- Distance is measured in [**Watches**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot and on maintained roads.
- See [this page](/wip/2e/example-setting) for an example setting.

## Theme
Established facts about the setting. Good questions to answer: 
- How does magic work?
- What level of technology do the denizens have?
- How does religion function? Do gods walk the lands, and do the people know it?
- Who are the PCs in the setting? What is theirposition with respect to those in power?
- What species & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
- What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting? 

### Scale
- **Small**: A single **Province** whose **Heart** is typically a large village, no more than _four_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.  
- **Medium**: 2-4 **Provinces** who share a **Heart** (typically a large town), no more than _eight_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.
- **Large**: 5-10 **Provinces** who share a **Heart** (typically a large city), no more than _sixteen_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.

## Provinces
- A **Province** is a single, traversable landscape roughly defined by divisble terrain (mountain ranges, rivers, oceans). 
- A **Domain** is one or more adjacent **Provinces** defined by the same ruler(s). 
- Each **Province** has a **Heart**: a settlement (of any size) that reflects the history, **Factions**, and peoples of the land.

### Creating a Province
1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a dot to signify the **Heart** (a village, town, or city) of the **Province**. Number it **1**. 
2. Create three more dots in a triangle with the **Heart** in the rough center. Each of these dots represents an additional **Detail** on the map. Number these as well, in the order you create them.
3. Connect two of the dots to the **Heart**, using solid lines to represent roads, dotted lines for trails, double solid lines for rivers, and double dotted lines and tunnels. Connect the remaining dot to one of these paths, crossing it and continuing for a distance. 
4. Repeat step #2, orienting the triangle of dots in a different way than before. Number each dot.
5. Connect two of the new dots to _any_ path, numbering each as you go. Do not connect the final dot.
6. Create a new dot wherever paths cross, and wherever a new path ends. Number them as you go.

> You can use other shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, etc) to create dots instead. Try varying the distance between dots for each successive **Province**. You can repeat this process for any adjacent **Provinces**, connecting them by road, river, or range.  


### Adding Terrain
1. Roll on the [Hub Terrain](#hub-terrain) table to determine the **Heart**'s terrain. Choose **one** terrain from the results. 
2. Roll on the [Near Terrain](#near-terrain) table to determine the terrain for any dots _two_ hops or fewer from the **Heart**. Choose **one** terrain from the results for each.
3. Roll on the [Far Terrain](#far-terrain) for any dots that are _three_ or more hops from the **Heart**, as well as those not connected to any path. Choose **one** terrain from the results for each.
4. Drawn or indicate the terrain for each dot on the map.

## Details
- Each dot on the map is one **Detail**. **Details** act as [**Points**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) according to the [**Wilderness Exploration**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration) rules. 
- Keep in mind how many **Watches** it might take to travel to each **Detail**. 
- The **Heart** of a **Province** is always a settlement. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place people live, but it does always have a significant history. 

### Adding Details
1. Roll on the [Settlments](#settlements) and [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) tables to generate the **Heart** of the **Province**.
2. Generate features for each remaining dot by first rolling on the the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table.
3. For any additional settlements rolled, roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table as well.

> If some of the results below seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn it into a question: _Why_ is there hazard terrain so close to a settlement? Perhaps there were mines there once, long abandoned. Rumors as to their true treasure - and dangers - abound. That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

### Detail Names
Starting with the **Heart**, name each **Detail** on the map based on its unique terrain, feature, or history. 
- Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. Then, the residents add a noun or adjective. _Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Pitty Gardens_, etc.
- Wilderness and dangerous places are even more obvious: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: _Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path_, etc. 
- Important places should have important names: that of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events. _The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine_, etc.

## Factions
- Factions rule over one or more **Details**, an entire **Province**, or even a **Domain**. 
- The map should reflect the impact of goals being completed or interrupted. **Factions** will work to achieve their goals independently.
- A **Faction** may be governed by a powerful figure, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with their lieutenants, or **Seneschals**. 

### Agendas & Resources
- Factions have **Agendas** (3-4 steps towards a clear goal) and the **Resources** to help achieve them. 
- A faction's **Resources** reflect its influence, resources, wealth, and special features. 
- Factions grow (or lose) their **Resources** by trying to complete their agenda. 

### Creating Factions
- Consider the **Details** and **Terrain** you've developed. Note what is worth protecting, as well as what is worth taking.
- **Agendas** are lofty plans with distinct steps based on actionable goals. They should relate to the acquisition of powerful territory, weapons, money, and **Resources**. 
- Do not feel limited by the table results below. If something feels "off" or a different table result would work better for your setting, use it!

#### Factions Creation Procedure
1. Starting with the **Heart**, roll on the [Faction Types](#faction-types), the [Faction Resources](#faction-resources), and the [**Faction Agendas**](#faction-agendas) tables for every Settlement **Detail** on the map.
2. Create **Resources** as indicated by the results from the table. Consider how many **Resources** a **Faction** of this type might have (between **2-4**). Roll accordingly.
3. Roll on the [Faction Obstacles](#faction-obstacles) table. Use the result to consider what might prevent the **Agenda** from succeeding.
4. Create at least one **Seneschal**, inspired by the **Faction** type, **Resources**, and **Agenda**. Think of where they might be located on the map this is the **Faction's** home base.
5. Select a Lair or Ruin on the map. Follow steps 1-3 to make at least one **Faction** for that site. Repeat as desired.
6. Create at least one alliance and at least one conflict between the **Factions**. Consider the region's history, the **Resources** of each **Faction**, who might want them, and what someone would do to _get_ them.

Consider the following when determining the **Province** name:
- What are the key geographic features of the region? 
- What major events (war, famine, discoveries) occured here in the past? Who were the major players?
- What sort of factions have historically dominated this place?
- A name may also include a reference to the region's relative position to the seat of power: _The Northeast Redoubt_, _Western Ranges_, etc.
- The name (first, or family) of a "discoverer", conquerer or colonizer often sticks around long after their death.


## Conclusion
Congratulations, your **Province** is complete! You can now "drill down" into various locations (starting with the hub) and build out each **Detail** with your favorite tables. Keep the following thoughts in mind as you do:
- How might the interactions between the **Factions** interact with the landscape, its features, and one another? How will this change as the **Factions** succeed (or fail) at their goals? 
- Consider the history of the region's original "discoverers", the locals they may have supplanted, and where both groups are today. 
- When building out the next **Province**, keep in mind how it would have interacted historically with this **Province**, and what might happen between them in the future.
