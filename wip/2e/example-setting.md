# Example Setting

## Theme
- Low-magic (magic is known but rarely understood).
- Technology is 13th or 14th century (gunpowder, longbows, some agricultural innovations, pre-printing press).
- Religion exists, but is murky and unprovable. Deities do not necessarily walk the lands, though some believe they do.
- PCs are Human-only, and are neutral towards the centers of power.
- Names & proper nouns are largely plain English. Themes are inspired by the British Isles, Germany, and Eastern Europe.

## Domain Scale
- **Medium**: 2-4 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large town). The distance between a settled **Detail** and the central hub is no more than _sixteen_ **Travel Watches** away. 

## Factions

### Earl of White
#### Resources
- Fealty of the plains villages and their farms (as detachment, stats as [Bandits](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/bandit/)).
- Control of significant food stores.
- **Seneschal**: Personal Chamberlain, stats as [Brigand](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/brigand/).

#### Agenda
- Promise this season's crop-yield to the  **Under-folk**. In exchange they will raid nearby villages.
- Bait & assassinate **Lord Alexey**, whose family owns the **Swift Mines**.  
- Marry the widow **Alexey** and inherit the mines, or buy them at a steep discount.

### Under-folk of **Swift Mines**
#### Resources
- 2d10+10 ratlike **Under-folk** residing peacefully in the **Swift Mines**, stats as [Kobold](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/kobold/).
- The **God-thumb**, which provides warmth and safety for the colony. 
- **Seneschal**: **Ka-ro**, stats as [Ettin](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/ettin/).

#### Agenda
- Protect the **God-thumb** at all costs.
- Find new sources of food for the coming winter. 

### The Potentate
#### Resources
- **Anonymity**: The ruling council speaks only through an anointed subject, **The Whisper**.  
- **Information**: There is little the Potentate's ubiquitous spies do not know.   
- As the ruling faction over multiple **Provinces**, detachments of soldiers can be summoned from the villages very quickly.
- **Seneschals**: **The Whisper**, stats as [banshee](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/banshee/), and **Lord Alexey**, stas as [buccaneer](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/buccaneer/).

#### Agenda
- Maintain the stability of the realm by crushing rising threats from other factions. 
- Deploy newly-garrisoned troops to all roads leading into the Capital, to uncover enemies of the realm through torture and force. 
- Crush the **The Will** and any other enemies threatening the realm. 

### The Will
#### Resources
- 2d10+10 [Acolytes](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/acolyte).
- **Seneschal**: **Arjen Vol Sonn**, stats as [Lich](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/lich/).
- **The Springhouse**, an abandoned keep once used by ancestors of the **Earl of White**, who used it to imprison and torture their political enemies. It is well-fortified and contains a small complex of jails beneath it. 

#### Agenda
- Send spies throughout the **Provinces** in search of the **God-thumb**.
- Steal the **God-thumb**, and command the **Under-folk** to overwhelm the capital and defeat the **Potentate**.
- Use the **God-thumb** to restore **Fria The Empty**, then rule the **Provinces**.

## Setting
### Terrain
- **Roads, grasslands, plains**
- **Forests, mountains, hills** 
- **Deserts, jungle, swamp**
