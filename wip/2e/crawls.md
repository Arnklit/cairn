# Crawls

## The Woods

### Building a Forestcrawl

1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a **dot** to signify the **Crown**.
2. Draw a single curving line stemming out from the **Crown**. This is the **trunk**. 
3. Draw three **branches** sprouting off from the **trunk**. 
4. Draw two short offshoots from each branch. They can vary in length.
5. Place a dot wherever lines intersect, e.g. when a branch meets the **trunk** or an offshoot _and_ at the terminus of every line.
6. Number each dot, starting with the **Crown**.
