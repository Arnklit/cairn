### Building The Wood

1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a **dot** to signify the **Crown**.
2. Create two lines stemming out from the **Crown**, forming a **trunk**. 
3. Connect these **dots** to the **Crown**, using solid lines to represent roads.
4. From the **Crown**, create another **dot** along a different path. 
5. Connect this new **dot** to the **Crown**.
6. Create another **dot** stemming from one of the initial **trunk**. 
7. Where the path from the new **dot** and the path from old **dot** cross, create another **dot**.
8. From one of the **dots** not directly connected to the **Crown**, draw a line and create a new **dot**.
9. Number the **dots**, starting from the **Crown** and expanding outwards.
