# Bonds and Omens

## Introduction

The goal is to encourage party cooperation, further questing, and character growth. Bonds & Omens should encourage the PCs to:
- Work together
- Make money (e.g. questing)
- Go on an adventure (baked-in quest hook)
- Fulfill an obligation
- Get back their [stuff, reputation, whatever]

## Bonds

|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **d20** | **Bond**                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **1**   | You inherited a single gem (cold and brittle, one slot) from a long-dead relative. It arrived with a warning: spend your riches (worth 500gp) and a debt long thought forgotten would be called.                 |
| **2**   | A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take **20gp**, and an **ornate compass** that always points towards something deep in **The Woods**.                                                              |
| **3**   | You carry a hand-drawn **portrait** of a past love who disappeared into **The Woods** long ago. Somehow, you know that they are still alive.                                                                     |
| **4**   | You trespassed on the **Wooded Dead's** sacred grove. To atone you must retrieve a corpsewood sapling. They grow in places populated only by the dead.                                                           |
| **5**   | You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some **silver moss**. Swallow it near water and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt.                                             |
| **6**   | You inherited an old **journal**, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly from the journal's perspective. The writing is crude, but accurate.                      |
| **7**   | You protect a long-dormant family secret. Take one half of an **ancient key**. They say that if joined with its twin, it opens a **Gate** through any door.                                                      |
| **8**   | A mysterious Fae lord has asked you to close a **Gate** in a field not far from your village. In return, they will reveal your true parentage. Take a **sealed scroll** with the details of the task.            |
| **9**   | You owe a great debt to a figure of some nobility, and carry their **signet ring**, which serves as proof both of their protection as well as your obligation.                                                   |
| **10**  | You consumed a mischievous spirit that now periodically wreaks havoc on your insides, demanding to be taken home. It wants to keep you alive, albeit uncomfortably. You still carry the **bottle** it came from. |
| **11**  | A former mentor is dying of a rare disease. The healing herbs they require are found only in **The Woods**, but are dangerous to acquire. Take a **waterproof pouch**.                                           |
| **12**  | During your travels, you met a dying hunter who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a **letter**, sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the **Lord of Winter**.                     |
| **13**  | Someone close to you traded a family heirloom to a shadowy entity from **The Cobbles**. Take a **sketch of the artifact**.                                                                                       |
| **14**  | You promised a childhood friend that you'd bring them back a rare gift, something unique in all the world. Take a **bracelet** woven from twine and wildflowers.                                                 |
| **15**  | You crossed a creature of **The Wood**, and it cursed you with a **stone heart** (bulky). With each passing month, the stone grows heavier by one slot. Until your debt is lifted, you cannot truly die.         |
| **16**  | You carved a **whistle** from an **Oak Lord's** branch. Your act did not go unnoticed. You cannot seem to rid yourself of the whistle either.                                                                    |
| **17**  | The **Dawn Brigade** did your family a service and gave you a dried blood-red flower as proof. If the flower turns white, it means the favor is owed.                                                            |
| **18**  | An entertainer once visited your home, filling it with story and song. He left one day with hardly a note, leaving behind only **a miniature lute**. Something rattles inside.                                   |
| **19**  | You trespassed on a Fey lord's grove. To be allowed to leave, you must give up something of great importance to you. Take an **ornate dagger** with a gemstone pommel.                                           |
| **20**  | One of your ancestors wronged a moss witch, cursing their bloodline. Mirrors always break with your reflection, but its shards can reveal illusion.                                                              |

## Omens

|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **d20** | **Omen**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **1**   | The once rich waters of a life-giving river have turned black and putrid, tainting the land and sickening those who drink from it. A village elder points to some recent desecration as the cause, but most do not heed her words.                                       |
| **2**   | It feels like winter has arrived too quickly this year, frost and snows making their appearance much earlier than expected. There is talk of a pattern to the frost found in windows, ponds, and cracks in the ground. It looks almost like a map.                       |
| **3**   | A thick, unnatural fog has descended upon an ancient and holy grove, and is slowly expanding. It is said to be the work of a great forest spirit, angered by nearby deforestation.                                                                                       |
| **4**   | The night sky grows dimmer each evening, as if stars are disappearing one by one. Reports talk of deadly creatures crawling up from **The Roots** and attacking villagers.  Scholars are urging calm, but the rumors are spreading like wildfire.                        |
| **5**   | The songbirds of **The Woods** have fallen eerily silent as of late. Hunters claim that a spectral figure has been spotted wandering the forest, gazing longingly at any it encounters.                                                                                  |
| **6**   | Strange, tear-shaped stones have been found throughout the region, sparking a "gold rush" of sorts that has drawn jewelers and thieves alike. The locals believe they are the tears of the earth itself, weeping for a great tragedy yet to come.                        |
| **7**   | Swarming pests gnaw away at the edges of your dreams, portending a grim future harvest. Farmers speak of a loud buzzing sound emanating from deep within The Woods.                                                                                                      |
| **8**   | In your village there lies a mother tree. They say it has always been there, holding the town's secrets in its boughs and roots. Recently it began bleeding red sap, and the elders are worried. Take a **leaf** from the tree. It turns a deep red when danger is near. |
| **9**   | The moon turns a deep crimson, bathing the night in an eerie, blood-red light. Some say it heralds a time of chaos and strife, as the boundaries between **The Woods** and the mortal realm grow thin.                                                                   |
| **10**  | You found a wounded beast in the forest, but chose to ignore it. You see it everywhere now, but only when you're alone. It looks sad, but not angry.                                                                                                                     |
| **11**  | A night-blooming flower once thought extinct is sprouting up throughout **The Woods**. Its scent is intoxicating, but also causes vivid nightmares.                                                                                                                      |
| **12**  | Rumors are that the local livestock have grown increasingly agitated and unmanageable as of late. An old shephard says its due to an unsettling howl that echoes from **The Woods** each full moon.                                                                      |
| **13**  | Swarms of insects are fleeing from **The Woods** in droves, destroying any wooden structures they come across. The sound of their wings hum a familiar tune as they pass overhead, like a forgotten nursery rhyme.                                                       |
| **14**  | Hunters talk of a curse that befalls any who kill a white-frocked beast; soon after, they are found dead in their homes. Those that eat the creatures meet no such fate. There are fewer and fewer creatures to hunt, each day now.                                      |
| **15**  | Folks are saying that a faint laughter can be heard, echoiing out of wells all over **The Cobbles**. At night, they say it sounds like sobbing, instead.                                                                                                                 |
| **16**  | The constellations have slowly started shifting in the night sky, forming unfamiliar patterns that have stargazers and sages perplexed. Even the animals seem disturbed.                                                                                                 |
| **17**  | An ancient tree at the heart of the sleepy village has suddenly withered and died, despite showing no signs of disease. After its trunk was cut, a bloody hand was found in its core.                                                                                    |
| **18**  | Statues throughout **The Cobbles** have been weeping tears of blood each month, and no babies have been born for a bit longer than the elders think possible. Save for one, whisked away by the authorities for its own safety.                                          |
| **19**  | Local fauna are behaving oddly, with reports of animals acting out of character, displaying heightened aggression, or fleeing the area entirely. Hunters talk of a shadowy figure that roams **The Woods**, driving the animals mad.                                     |
| **20**  | Border towns have become riotous in recent weeks, after multiple claims of a red-robed figure appearing in their children's dreams, uttering the same warning: A fire is coming, and it will consume them all.                                                           |
