# Dungeon Exploration

### Dungeon Turns 
A dungeon turn is approximately 10 minutes. Dungeon exploration can be turned into a subsystem of managing resources, making strategic decisions, and structuring the dungeon crawl into a sort of mini-game. There is an element of pushing your luck as you spend more time searching, checking for hidden things, and lingering in dangerous locations. Time spent always has a cost, and that cost is provoking an encounter roll. These encounters can involve running into monsters, but can also challenge or reward the party in other ways. 

### Sequence of Player Per Turn 
**1. Encounter Roll:** GM makes a d6 loaded encounter roll once every few dungeon turns, or at their discretion.  
**2. Actions:** The party decides what action to take. (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms).   
**3. Description:** GM describes & resolves what happens. If encounters were rolled, they happen here. If (1) was rolled on the encounter die, make a reaction roll and proceed from there.   
**4. End of turn:** GM updates time, and management of light, food, need to rest, or any sort of usage dice rolls can be made. 

### Dungeon Turn Movement 
Players can move **carefully** about 200 ft. in a 10 minute turn.  Players moving carefully spot signs of all traps. Traps should be designed to be disarmed or subverted with ingenuity and creative thinking using common sense and inventory. Players can quickly move 600 ft. in a 10-minute turn. Players moving **quickly** may get a chance to roll under WIL to notice a trap (GM discretion). Otherwise, they may trigger a trap if it is concealed (usually 1-2 on a d6, adjust as necessary for trap deadliness).

### Searching
- A quick search takes 1 minute, covers roughly a 30x30’ space, and reveals only the most obvious information.
- A detailed search takes 10 minutes (1 turn), covers roughly a 30x30’ space, and reveals most hidden information.
- You can replace 30x30 with small, medium, and large rooms, and require additional turns to complete a detailed search.

### Loaded Encounter Roll 
- Roll a d6 encounter dice every 2 or 3 rounds (at your discretion, adjust as needed) or when players make noise. 
- Only a roll of 1 will result in an encounter, and they won’t always be hostile. 
- Roll the reaction dice to see their disposition, and remember that they’re already doing something. 
- Optionally, you can roll non-loaded encounters with only and encounter occurring on a roll of 1, while nothing else happens otherwise.

**1. Encounter** (roll on encounter table or choose, roll reactions + wants)  
**2. Sign** (Clue, “spoor”, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, droppings, etc.)  
**3.  Locality** (context-dependent timer, water rising, ritual completing, The party's surroundings shift or escalate in some way.)  
**4. Exhaustion** (rest next round or deprived)  
**5. Expiration** (Ongoing effects end, light usage roll, resource usage, bellies rumble.)  
**6. Discovery or Treasure** (The party finds something interesting and possibly beneficial.)  

### Light 
Torches, lanterns, and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ clearly and provide dim outlines and shadows for a further 40’. In the dark, light sources are visible miles away. Standard torches will last about 6 turns, or 1 hour, before they burn out.
