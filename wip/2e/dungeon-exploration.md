# Dungeon Exploration

## Introduction
- Although the term "dungeon" is used here, it can be exchanged for any dangerous locale (mansions, farmhouses, adventure site, etc).
- In general, PCs may be required to take risks, add a **Fatigue** to their inventory, or spend a **resource** in order to complete a task quickly, or safely.
- The goal of these rules is twofold: to keep the sense of danger ever-present, and to maintain a consistent sense of time and resources used. 

## The Basics
- A character can perform one **action** during a **dungeon turn**. 
- Actions are any extended activities, such as _searching for traps or treasure_, _forcing open a door_, _listening for danger_, _disarming a trap_, _engaging an enemy in combat_, etc.
- A dungeon room is typically **small**, **medium** or **large**. 
- Some activities take longer than one **dungeon turn**, if the room is very **large**, or the task especially difficult. 

## Dungeon Exploration Sequence
1. The characters enter a new location. The **Warden** describes the environment and any obvious dangers.
2. Any immediate consequences are dealt with (combat, traps, surprises).
3. Character declare their next intended action (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms, engaging an enemy in combat).
4. The **Warden** resolves each character's actions simultaneously, using the [**Common Action**](#common-actions) where appropriate. If an action would take longer than one **dungeon turn**, the **Warden** describes the character's progress.
5. The **Warden** rolls on the [**Dungeon Events**](#dungeon-events) table.
6. The players and the **Warden** record any relevant loss of resources and relevant effects (i.e. torch use, _deprivation_, etc).

#### Event Triggers
- If the characters make a lot of noise (accidently or otherwise) or trigger an impending event, the **Warden** should also roll on the [**Dungeon Events**](#dungeon-events) table.

### Dungeon Events

|       |                 |                                                              |
| :---: | :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| **1** |   **Danger**    |                 A hostile encounter ensues.                  |
| **2** |  **Encounter**  | Roll on an encounter table. Not necessarily hostile (see NPC [reactions](/cairn-srd/#reactions)) |
| **3** |    **Sign**     | Clue, “spoor”, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, droppings, etc. |
| **4** | **Environment** | The party's surroundings shift or escalate in some way. Water rising, ceiling collapsing, a ritual nearing completion, etc. |
| **5** | **Exhaustion**  | The PCs may need to rest soon or are forced to take a **Fatigue** or become _deprived_. |
| **6** | **Expiration**  | An ongoing effect ends (torches, magic, etc). Rations or other resources are used up. |

## Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ of dungeon, but beyond provide only a dim outlines of objects.
- A torch burns about 6 **dungeon turns** before it fizzles out. Lanterns and other light sources may differ.
- Characters without a light source suffer from _panic_ until their situation is remedied. 

## Panic
- A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing a great fear may experience _panic_.
- A **WIL** **save** is required to avoid becoming _panicked_, after which they may attempt once per **dungeon turn**. 
- A _panicked_ character is _always_ **surprised** and has 0 HP. All of their attacks are _impaired_. 
- A _panicked_ character automatically fails **WIL** and **DEX** saves. 
   
## Traps 
- **Traps** are detected (and generally avoided) by carefully **searching** a room. Only the character **searching** a room avoids triggering a trap. 
- If a character makes an action that could trigger a trap, there is usually a 2-in-6 of it being sprung. 
- Damage from traps is taken from ability scores (usually **STR** or **DEX**) and _not_ from HP. Armor can reduce damage, but only if applicable (e.g. a shield would not reduce damage from noxious gas).

## Common Actions

## Move
- One or more characters move to another room, or down a long corridor or tunnel. 
- Characters generally move slowly (up to 40ft) if _carefully_ exploring a location. 
- Rushing through a dangerous area can be perilious, and actions like **Searching** and **Resting** are not possible.
- Characters are assumed to be moving through areas in such a way that they avoid being **surprised**.  

## Interact
- A character engages with a creature or element in the room. 
- Obvious information about a room should always be offered freely and at no cost, regardless of the room's size.

## Rest
- **Resting** takes one **dungeon turn**, and relieves _deprivation_ and _panic_.
- A light source and a safe location are required to **rest**.

## Search
- A character can spend a **dungeon turn** performing a an _exhaustive search_ that reveals any hidden treasure, traps, doors, or information they could possibly uncover. 
- Secret doors and hidden treasure are _always_ uncovered by a **search**, unless otherwise noted.

## Listen
- A character can listen to the sounds of denizens and other hazards through nearby doors and walls. Generally they have a 1-in-6 chance of detecting subtle sounds. 
- If a creature or dangers is particularly noisy, the **Warden** should simply inform the party through one of the other actions. 

## Force
- Doors and entryways may be locked, stuck, moving or blocked entirely. Characters can try to force a door open (or wedge it shut) using available resources (spikes, glue), or through raw ability (**STR** or **DEX**). 
- The character _most at risk_ should **save** to avoid whatever danger may befall them (a trapped appendage, engraged monsters, etc).
