# Dungeon Exploration

## The Basics
- A dungeon **turn**** lasts approximately 10 minutes.
- Each character in the party can perform one **action** during a **turn**. 
- Actions are extended activities like searching for traps or treasure,  forcing open a stuck door, listening for danger or information, disarming traps, etc.
- Some activities may take longer, especially if the room is large or the task at hand especially difficult. The duration for these tasks are counted in turns, i.e. "that will take two turns to complete".
- In general, PCs may be required to take **Fatigue** or spend a **resource** in order to complete a task quickly, or safely.
- A dungeon room is typically **small**, **medium** or **large**. 
- Although the term "dungeon" is used here, it can be exchanged for any enclosed space (mansions, farmhouses, etc).
- The goal of these rules is twofold: to keep the sense of danger ever-present, and to maintain a consistent sense of time and resources used.

## Exploration Sequence
1. The **Warden** describes the room.
2. The Players declare their intended actions (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms).
3. The **Warden** resolves the actions.
4. The **event die** is rolled.
5. Repeat 1-4 until a PC departs the room.

## Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ of dungeon, but beyond provide only a dim outlines of objects.
- A torch lasts about 6 **turns** (or one hour) before it burns out. Lanterns and other light sources may differ.

## Searching
- Obvious information about a room should always be offered freely and at no cost, regardless of the room's size.
- A character can spend a **turn** performing a an _exhaustive search_ that reveals any hidden treasure, traps, doors, or information they could possibly uncover.
