# Dungeon Exploration

## Introduction
- Although the term "dungeon" is used here, it can be exchanged for any dangerous locale (mansions, farmhouses, adventure site, etc).
- In general, PCs may be required to take risks, add a **Fatigue** to their inventory, or spend a **resource** in order to complete a task quickly, or safely.
- The goal of these rules is twofold: to keep the sense of danger ever-present, and to maintain a consistent sense of time and resources used. 

## The Basics
- A dungeon **turn** lasts approximately 10 minutes.
- Each character in the party can perform one **action** during a **turn**. 
- Actions are extended activities like searching for traps or treasure, forcing open a door, listening for danger, disarming traps, engaging an enemy in combat, etc.
- A dungeon room is typically **small**, **medium** or **large**. 
- Some activities take longer than one **turn**, if the room is very **large**, or the task especially difficult. 

## Dungeon Exploration Sequence
1. The **Warden** describes the room or location.
2. Each character declares their intended action (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms, engaging an enemy in combat).
3. The **Warden** resolves each character's actions.
4. After six consecutive **turns** (or 1 hour), the **Warden** rolls on the [[**Dungeon Events**]](#dungeon-events) table.
5. The players and the **Warden** record the relevant loss of resources and relevant effects (i.e. torch use, _deprivation_, etc).

#### Event Triggers
- If the characters make a lot of noise (accidently or otherwise) or trigger an impending event, the **Warden** may also roll on the [[**Dungeon Events**]](#dungeon-events) table.

## Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ of dungeon, but beyond provide only a dim outlines of objects.
- A torch lasts about 6 **turns** (or one hour) before it burns out. Lanterns and other light sources may differ.
- Characters without a light source are considered **lost** until their situation is remedied. Their HP is 0 as they cannot defend themselves. 

## Traps 
- **Traps** are detected (and generally avoided) by carefully **Searching** a room. Only the character taking the **Searching** a room avoids triggering a trap. 
- If a character makes an action that could trigger a trap, there is usually a 2-in-6 of it being sprung. 
- Damage from traps is taken from ability scores (usually **STR** or **DEX**) and _not_ from HP. Armor can reduce damage, but only if applicable (e.g. a shield would not reduce damage from noxious gas).

## Surprise
- Characters are assumed to be moving through areas in such a way that they avoid being **surprised**.  
- **Lost** characters are _always_ **surprised**, and cannot enter combat - they only avoid danger through **Saves**.

## Common Actions

## Move
- Characters generally move slowly (up to 40ft) if _carefully_ exploring a location.  
- Rushing through a dangerous area can be perilious, and actions like **Searching** and **Resting** are not possible. 

## Rest
- **Resting** takes one **turn**, and relieves _deprivation_ and any other minor conditions.

## Search
- Obvious information about a room should always be offered freely and at no cost, regardless of the room's size.
- A character can spend a **turn** performing a an _exhaustive search_ that reveals any hidden treasure, traps, doors, or information they could possibly uncover. 
- Secret doors and hidden treasure 

## Listen
- Characters can listen to the sounds of denizens and other hazards through nearby doors and walls. Generally they have a 1-in-6 chance of detecting subtle sounds. 
- If a creature or dangers is particularly noisy, the **Warden** should simply inform the party through one of the other actions. 

## Force
- Doors and entryways may be locked, stuck, moving or blocked entirely. Characters can try to force a door open (or wedge it shut) using available resources (spikes, glue), or through raw ability (**STR** or **DEX**). 
- The character _most at risk_ should **save** to avoid whatever danger may befall them (a trapped appendage, engraged monsters, etc).
