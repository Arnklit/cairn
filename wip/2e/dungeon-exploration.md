# Dungeon Exploration

## The Basics
- A dungeon **phase**** lasts approximately 10 minutes.
- Each character can choose one **Dungeon Action** during a **phase**.
- A dungeon room is typically **small**, **medium** or **large**. 
- Although the term "dungeon" is used here, it can be exchanged for any enclosed space (mansions, farmhouses, etc).

## Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ of dungeon, but beyond provide only a dim outlines of objects. 
- A torch lasts about 6 **phases** (or 1 hour) before they burn out.

## Exploration Sequence
1. The **Warden** describes the room.
2. The Players declare their intended actions (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms).
3. The **Warden** resolves the actions.
4. The **event die** is rolled.
5. Repeat 1-4 until a PC departs the room.

## Dungeon Actions

## Searching
- Obvious information about a room should always be offered freely and at no cost, regardless of the room's size.
- A character can spend a **phase** performing a an _exhaustive search_ that reveals any hidden treasure, traps, doors, or information they could possibly uncover.
