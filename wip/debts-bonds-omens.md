## Omens

### Omens for The Cobbles:

**The Devoured Fields**: Swarming pests gnaw away at the edges of your dreams, portending a grim future harvest. Farmers speak of a loud buzzing sound emanating from deep within The Woods. 

**The Whispering Walls**: Sinister murmurs echo through the streets, sowing discord and mistrust among the populace. Although its origins are unknown, many have declared The Roots as the source. 

**The Choked River**: The life-giving waters of the city's river have turned black and putrid, tainting the land and sickening those who drink from it. Rumors suggest that an ancient curse from **The Woods** has befallen the river.

### Omens for The Woods:

**The Wailing Trees**: A haunting chorus of anguished cries echoes through the forest. Some say an otherworldly presence from **The Roots** has seeped into the earth, infecting the woods with its sorrow. Each day the voices of tree and bird alike grows more quiet.

**The Shrouded Path**: A thick, unnatural fog has descended upon an ancient and holy grove, and is slowly expanding. It is said to be the work of a great spirit, disturbed by the expansion of **The Cobbles**.

### Omens for The Roots:

**The Trembling Depths**: A rumble echoes beneath the Earth, shaking the foundations of stone and wood. Creatures unseen for millennia have been seen near a supposedly broken **Gate**.

**The Vanished Stair**: A well-trod and "safe" **Gate** to **The Roots** has inexplicably vanished, swallowed by darkness. The progeny of a powerful noble has since disappeared, some say trapped below. His father has issued formal offers of land and title to those willing to brave the deeps.

### More Omens

**Omens for The Cobbles:**

**The Crumbling Tower:** A once-proud and ancient tower begins to crumble, its stones falling like rain. Whispers among the citizens of The Cobbles suggest it's a sign of impending disaster, with the blame placed on an artifact stolen from The Roots.

**The Dying Light:** The city's lanterns and torches flicker and dim, seemingly unable to hold a steady flame. Some believe it to be the work of vengeful spirits from The Woods, seeking to plunge The Cobbles into eternal darkness.

**Omens for The Woods:**

**The Blighted Glade:** A once-verdant glade in The Woods now withers and decays, its leaves turning black and twisted. Rumors suggest that a cursed relic from The Roots has been buried within the glade, tainting the land with its malevolence.

**The Silent Song:** The birds and beasts of The Woods have fallen eerily silent, their songs and calls replaced by a pervasive stillness. Some claim that the silence is the work of a powerful entity from The Roots, seeking to assert its dominance over the natural world.

**Omens for The Roots:**

**The Shattered Gate:** A long-forgotten Gate to The Roots lies shattered and broken, its remnants covered in a thick layer of dust. Whispers among the denizens of The Cobbles suggest that an ancient force, long imprisoned within The Roots, has finally broken free.

**The Unending Shadow:** A darkness creeps through The Roots, consuming all light in its path. The denizens of The Cobbles and The Woods whisper in hushed tones about the approaching shadow, fearing that it heralds the end of all things.



## Debts

**The Wooded Dead**: A group of benign Forest Liches  demand you plant a grove of rare (and expensive) **Corpsewood** trees after you (accidentally) trespassed on their sacred grove. The saplings grow wherever the dead rest in great numbers. Until your debt is paid, travelling through **The Woods** is slower, and forest critters shy away from you.  

**The Dawn Brigade**: They helped get you out, asking for only one thing in return: Cross the border. Deep in the frontier there is a glade of primrose and ash. In its center is a **Blood Flower**. You have three months to bring it to them before **The Bloodhounds** find you.

**The Cobbles**:  
**The Ironscale Syndicate**: You borrowed money from a notorious criminal organization to cover a desperate need. They expect you to repay the loan with considerable interest. (500gp) Until the debt is paid, their enforcers will hound you, making it difficult to rest or find sanctuary in **The Cobbles**.

**Seeds of Fortune**: Your family owes a large sum of money to a moneylender from **The Cobbles** to sponser a failed crop. With no way to repay the debt, you cannot return home or step foot in **The Cobbles** without risking their wrath.

**The Roots**:  
**The Cost of Freedom**: You paid dearly for a chance to escape **The Roots** and your enemies there. The price remains unpaid, and now your liberators are demanding the fee, plus interest (250gp). It would cost them nothing to throw you down the nearest **Gate** and inform your enemies of your whereabouts. 

**The Crimson Oath**: You swore a blood oath to a warrior who saved your life in battle. They have called upon you to honor that oath by joining their quest to avenge a fallen comrade. If you break this bond, you will be forever branded a dishonarable coward amongst the people of the frontier.

**The Sacred Hunt**: A revered beast roams the frontier, a symbol of the wild and untamed spirit of the land. You were chosen by the elders to partake in the ritual hunt for this creature. To refuse would be to dishonor your people and bring misfortune upon your kin.

**Famine Relief**: A local village provided you with food and shelter during a time of great need. They expect you to return the favor by finding a solution to the blight that has stricken their crops. 

**The Relic's Due**: The party unknowingly acquired a powerful relic that belongs to a forgotten deity. To appease the deity and avoid its wrath, they must return the relic to its rightful place within a hidden temple in The Woods.

**The Shadow's Toll**: The party has drawn the attention of a powerful and secretive organization from The Cobbles. To escape their watchful gaze and earn their trust, the party must complete a dangerous mission deep in the heart of The Roots.

**The Beast's Bargain**: The party accidentally trespassed on the territory of a mighty creature from The Woods. To repay the creature and ensure their safe passage, they must track down and eliminate a rival beast that threatens its domain.

**The Lost Knowledge**: A sage from The Cobbles has tasked the party with recovering a lost tome from a forgotten library in The Roots. In exchange for their services, the sage promises to clear the party's outstanding debts and grant them valuable information.

**The Warden's Task**: The party has unwittingly violated a sacred pact between The Woods and The Cobbles. To restore the balance and avoid retribution, they must journey to The Roots and retrieve a powerful artifact that will mend the broken bond.

**The Cursed Bounty**: To clear a debt owed to a wealthy patron from The Cobbles, the party has been tasked with acquiring a rare gemstone hidden within The Woods. However, they soon discover that the gemstone carries a dark curse, forcing them to seek a means to break the curse in The Roots.

**The Forgotten Heir**: A noble from The Cobbles has enlisted the party's help in locating their long-lost heir, rumored to be living in exile within The Woods. In return, the noble promises to absolve the party of their debts and grant them favors in high society.

**The Earth's Reclamation**: The party has inadvertently disrupted a delicate balance in The Roots, angering the spirits that dwell within. To appease the spirits and restore harmony, they must embark on a quest to recover a sacred artifact hidden within The Woods.

**The Smuggler's Debt**: The party owes a favor to a notorious smuggler from The Cobbles. To repay the debt, they must assist in transporting a valuable and dangerous cargo through the treacherous paths of The Woods, avoiding both natural and supernatural threats along the way.

**The Binding Pact**: The party has entered into a binding pact with a mysterious entity from The Roots. In order to free themselves from the pact and its dire consequences, they must complete a dangerous quest that will take them through The Woods and into the heart of The Cobbles.




### Extra Omens

**The Shattered Grove**: A great oak in the heart of The Woods has been split asunder, signaling the awakening of an ancient forest spirit. It's said that if the spirit's anger is not appeased, a terrible curse will befall the land. You must find a way to mend the broken tree and calm the spirit.

**The Howling Shadows**: Strange creatures have been seen stalking the edges of the fields, their haunting cries echoing through the trees. An old prophecy suggests their appearance heralds a great calamity. You must uncover the truth behind the creatures and avert the disaster they portend.

**The Blighted Bounty**: You begin to see ghostly tendrils of corruption creeping through the fields, whispering of a blight that will consume all. Seek out the source of this dark power and sever its malignant grip before it's too late.

**The Harbinger Swarm**: The relentless advance of the pests is an omen of a greater, hidden threat. As the skies darken with their countless wings, uncover the sinister force that drives them and put an end to their reign of terror.

**The Ravaged Earth**: The relentless pests leave behind a landscape scarred and poisoned. In the skeletal remains of once-thriving crops, you glimpse a vision of a land forever lost, unless you can find a way to restore balance.

**The Withering Horde**: The pestilence preys upon the weak and vulnerable, leaving only devastation in its wake. As the shadows of hunger and despair grow longer, it falls to you to stand against the encroaching darkness and protect your people.

**The Unseen Scourge**: The pests seem to defy all reason and logic, appearing from nowhere and vanishing without a trace. Their elusive nature is a harbinger of an ancient, hidden malice that threatens to consume everything in its path.

**The Desolate Harvest**: The locusts descend upon the crops like a living cloud, stripping them bare and leaving only ruin in their wake. In the aftermath, you glimpse a vision of a barren wasteland where life struggles to survive.

**The Plague Bearer**: The pests spread a vile disease in their wake, infecting the land and all who dwell within it. You feel the sickness growing within you, a warning of the grim fate that awaits unless you can find a cure.

**The Blackened Soil**: The infested fields wither and die, their essence corrupted by a terrible darkness. The soil itself seems to cry out in anguish, and only by purging the blight can you restore life to the land.

**The Shadowed Crop**: The once-lush fields lie in ruin, a monument to despair and loss. As you stand amidst the wreckage, you feel the weight of the omen upon your shoulders, driving you to seek redemption and prevent the pestilence from consuming all.
