# Localization Guide

Although the Cairn rules exist in many forms (PDF, Google Docs, Word, etc), the [SRD](/cairn-srd) is probably the best choice for ease of translation.

## Translating the SRD
1. Copy the [SRD Markdown](https://github.com/yochaigal/cairn/blob/main/cairn-srd.md) (click Raw) to a markdown editor such as [Typora](https://typora.com) or a web-based renderer like [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io). If you know how to use Git, you can use [Atom](atom.io). If you don't know markdown, don't worry! It's easy. Read more [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

2. Do the hard work of translating the core document. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) and [deepl.com](https://deepl.com) are good resources; you can even simply translate the entire document once, then look through it for corrections.

## Optional: Fork this Github Repo!
