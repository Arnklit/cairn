# Build An Adventure Site
---

## Spark Tables
- Generate at least 10 interesting phrases for inspiration.  
- To create a Spark Table, find a source (e.g. a PDF with related content). Create a word cloud. Clean up the words. Sort by d20 in two columns.
- [Example Spark Tables for Cairn](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3E3FsQVvjqAMVcDIVXXQmo9g6bH0fQBDbzRJ6K5F10/edit#gid=0).
- Images can also serve as sparks.


## Prep:
- Pick a theme for the area.
- Name (should reflect or theme). Some help [here](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/forest_names.php).
- Come up with a premise; typically an amazing location with a treasure to hunt.
- Dangers, Stakes, Motives, Urgency	----
- Ruling faction (if applicable) with trait(s) & motives; add some kind of counter balance (enemies or pre-existing/hidden faction).
- A map of a area:
- Draw at least four lines of any shape, each from a different color. Each line should cross another at least once. These lines represent roads or paths.
- Generate at least 3 Points of Interest: from tables; take in consideration the theme(s) and factions. Put these wherever the lines cross.
- Generate regional/hex features for each POI using tables and placing results in those POIs where it makes most sense.
- Place additional (especially hidden) dangers, encounters or NPCâ€™s in some of the POI.
- Add some travel/route complications, taking in consideration any POIs along the way.
- Detailed notes with additional info, including:
- Encounter table (1d6/2d6), with at least one result tied to the party or its members.
- Details on any treasure or relics (Who wants it? Where is it now? Why wasn't it ransacked before?), including maps.
- Notes describing rooms for a dungeon (one sentence describing obstacles, hazards, creatures or minor treasure).

## Generating Treasure:
- Spark Tables, Maze Rats, Adventuresmith or similar will help greatly here.
- Roll on tables - generate stuff.
- Look on the map and think of who would want that.
- Look on the map and think of where it could be now.
- Add 2-3 steps leading up to that place, so it's not obvious and needs leads. Basically reverse engineering.
- Add some sort of "dungeon" in the place where the treasure resides.
- Stock "rooms" of a dungeon (additional treasure goes here)
